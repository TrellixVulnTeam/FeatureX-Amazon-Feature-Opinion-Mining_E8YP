##all i received was the charger and the headset for my money.
##total garbage
[t]i can not use the phone. touch screen problems.
##i have problems with the phone the touch screen doesnt work.
[t]I lost my money.
##i could never use the phone, i never turned it on, i took it to several technical services, because i am out of the us i did not have an option, i did not find the fault, a total loss of money.
[t]Don't even think about it. NO PHONE IN THE BOX!

[t]Samsung is terrible and has the worst, most unknowledgeable customer support ever. This phone is way too frustrating to use.
##this is the worst phone i have ever owned.
##i got it, plugged it in, and some strange icons appeared on the screen.
##none of these icons are listed on the samsung support website nor in the user manual for the phone.
##i contacted customer care and they had no clue what they were either and could not help at all.
##i finally got it working but wanted to change the way the clock was displayed on the lock screen.
##again, no info in the manual or on the website.
##customer care said that it was not possible to change the display even though the pictures of the themes show it.
##again, after hours of frustration, i figured it out.
##same thing with the emergency alert settings.
##still haven't figured out how to turn those off and, again, samsung customer care is clueless as well.
##this would be a great phone if you could delete all the samsung apps and just run the basic android apps.
##never should have bought a samsung.
##i am frustrated with it daily and the battery life is terrible.
##i seriously consider returning it multiple times a day...

##no where on the phone does it say s8 it says "duos", seems like fake material, even thought it is a "international verison", it is still suppose to be samsung.

##inteterested in promoting this product and any samsung accessories.
[t]DO NOT buy anything from Wireless Place.
##i had this phone for less than a week before it started bugging and failing.
##do not buy the phone from this place, you only have 15 days warranty so if your phone fails after that you are screwed.
##i was lucky that mine died within a week.
##i repeat, do not buy a phone from this place.
##i decided to give them another opportunity buying the gear s3 which had a defective charger.
##if you care about your money do not but anything from this place.

[t]Worth it!
##this phone is amazing!
##1st of all because it was unlocked and i already have metro pcs.
##i took it to them and they were easily able to get it set up.
##one tip is that this come with a european plug, but all you have to do is go to the website and send an email explaining that you need an american attatchment and they will ship you one for free, i recieved two!
##this is what i sent them, "hello, i recently bought an international version of your unlocked samsung galaxy s8.
##it said to contact you if i was in need of a charger that fits american plugs.
##how do i go about getting one of these and how much are they from you?"
##this is what they replied with, "we will ship you usa plug for it free of charge."
##all i did was click on seller information and put it in an "ask a question."
##as for the phone it is very smart and connects well with other devices, such as a smart tv especially a samsung smart tv.
##bixby is the "siri" for this device and works great.
##it adjusts to your needs and even tells you people who you frequently contact at a certain time.
##this phone is easily customizable and the more you explore with it the more you will find.
##battery life and speed of charging is also phenomenal.

[t]Coming from the iOS world
##i have the phone for more than a month now, it's a beautiful phone, the display looks great, i can copy my photos and music and whatever i want freely to the computer and back unlike on an iphone.
##the fingerprint sensor is on the back - not as comfy as the front facing old iphone sensor but it's usable.
##it's not a one-hand phone it's a bit bigger than that and i have big hands.
##i love the pairing with the s3 gear and the samsung health app.
##it has face unlock and fingerprint reader and passcode.
##i miss the dedicated silent button from the iphone this needs to be unlocked before i can silence it but there is a completely unnecessary bixby button.
##there should be a silence button instead of that.
##the camera the iphone camera is markedly better i'm sorry to say that but looking at the photos i took and i take now i can see it.
##overall i think this is the best android phone you can get i might also get an iphone but not the x that is hideous with the notch the protruding camera and the glass back - maybe a 7 or 8. hope they'll come out with something better and i also hope samsung listens to users.
##we don't want the bixby.
##we want to be able to remap and reconfigure anything this coudl be your true ace vs iphone that will never allow it.
[t]Fragile but impressive piece of machinery.
##great phone and an excelllent upgrade from the s6 i had before.
##i unfortunately cracked the screen the day i bought it from an 8" drop.
##i purchased a case and screen protector rhe same day.
##i can't complain it's the nicest phone i've ever personally owned.
##i just am waiting for some innovated person to design a case & glass protector that does not interfere with the functionality of the phone and conforms to the curved glass.
##i did need to mention that the seller refused to even acknowledge my desire to return thebunopened item when i recieved it.
##i am happy i still own the telephone so all is good.

##great phone.
[t]Beautiful phone with great functionalities.
##beautiful phone with great functionalities and it is an incredible advancement from my old samsung galaxy avant which is a great working phone, but it's been getting buggy in the last six months.
##i got mine through fed ex this morning so i will update my post in a few weeks but so far, i could not be happier.
##i got my phone from a different vendor out of australia but shipped directly to me from hong kong, but i suspect it will be the same phone no matter when you buy it.
##my service provider is metro pcs, which i am very happy to find out that i can keep and i took my phone to my local metro pcs store and they got my phone working in less than 15 minutes.
##they explained the functions of the sim slot #1 and #2 and how to insert a micro card.
##i had metro add the international calling plan to my phone for texting and calls from the u.s. i will use the sim slot #2 for when i travel to france.
##having a backup will help out.
##the style and glass front of the phone is very nice and it does not leave fingerprints.
##my old phone is the samsung galaxy avant and i find that having my new phone is not difficult to re-learn.
##some of the basic functions are the same.
##after getting home, i entered my passcode for my home wi-fi and the phone took it immediately and updated itself promptly.
##i also got the bluetooth function connected to my fiat sport 500c in less than five minutes.
##the batter powers up in no time to full and this morning, out of the box, my phone was at about 50% power.
##it took about 30 minutes to get it to 100%.
##so far, the battery tends to drain slowly.
##i read from another post of this phone that it did not have wi-fi.
##not sure what happened, but this phone certainly does have it.
##the cord has a different end that plugs into the phone, so my old usb cords won't work however, the s8 box includes some attachments.
##one attachment is a small add-on that will fit on the small end of the usb cord so you can keep your old cords.
##the box also adds a connector so you can transfer files from one phone to another, or a computer to your phone and finally a 100-240 charging plug is included in the box, but it is not for european sockets nor american sockets.
##the two male connectors are slightly slanted so i suspect this is for asia.
##i am not going to clone my galaxy avant software to my new phone because i want to begin fresh again.
##i will pick and choose each app but my avant still works at home with my wi-fi and magic jack phone.
##there is only one slight disappointment; i expected the phone to be more of a gold tone color.
##the back of the phone is not really gold, but a slight gold tone with an odd color that seems to change color depending on the light available.
##also, the front glass is gold tone once you pull up the apps, sms, dialer, etc.
##i find this phone to be very advanced and a very good buy for the money i paid.
##it's basically a mini-computer and i use it for everything from driving, texting, phone, pictures, banking, buying, etc.
##this phone is definitely an incredible upgrade from my avant and i am very pleased.
##i will update my post in a few weeks to a month.

[t]Fantastic, but with one drawback.
##for clarification i have the u.s model of this phone with the snapdragon processor.
##i'm going to keep this review short and sweet because frankly i could talk about this phone all day.
##i've had this phone for a few months now and am now ready to review it, i'll break down this review into build quality, screen quality, weight, audio quality/call quality, processor speed, camera quality, battery life and ease of navigating the software.
##- build quality is outstanding, the phone looks and feels as good as it gets.the phone is a little slippery though so i do recommend a case for it, more on that later.
##-screen quality- this is by far the best display i have ever seen on a phone, samsungs amoled display technology is at the top of its game.
##colors pop,contrast is incredible and the blacks are truly black and because of the curved screen the content you view on it whether its photos or videos has an almost 3d effect to it.
##samsung also offers display adjustments in phone options if you want more neutral colors instead of the saturated colors amoled is known for, either way this display is top notch!
##weight- suprisingly light weight for how sturdy it feels.
##the s8 feels good in pocket and won't have you wishing you had a lighter phone anytime soon.
##audio quality/ call quality - audio with this phone is above average but not the best, music, movies, games all sound good whether you're using head phones or the phone speaker, the phone speaker does distort at high volumes though, but you'll most likely be using headphones anyway.
##the included earbuds that come with the phone were very good (at least before they shorted out) so heads up on that, also i'd recommend a eq app like power amp if you want to fine tune your sound.
##call quality on the other had is hands down phenomenal, i've made a lot of calls with this phone and have constantly been blown away with how crisp and clear the calls are.
##processor speed- calling this phone fast is an understatement, i've tried my best at times to get this phone to slow down and just can't do it.
##everything is snappy and instantaneous whether youre opening an app or loading a web page.
##this phone doesn't break a sweat!
##camera quality - the camera on this phone is fantastic, the photos are amazing, with one downside low light photos fo have more noise than i'd like in them.
##i'll attach some example's to this review so you can see for yourself.
##this phone won't replace a high end dedicated camera, but you could do a lot worse.
##battery life - i have to give credit to both samsung and android for this one.
##the battery life on this phone is outstanding, i can get two and a half days out of this phone easy.
##i'm pretty easy going on my phone though, i wouldn't call myself a power user by any means, but i didn't put this phone through its paces a couple times and and came out impressed, even with heavy usage and screen brightness turned all the way up this phone made it through a day and a half of nothing but videos, web surfing, and music playing with battery to spare.
##if you need even more run time, you can put the phone into varying degrees of battery saving modes that can squeeze out even more run time ( the emergency mode can give you months of battery time, granted you can't do much else besides make calls but it could be a life saver).
##ease of navigating software - short answer is its cake.
##the long answer is its intuitive and ridiculously easy to move around in menus and find what you are looking for.
##samsung has really out done themselves here and it shows.
##honestly i can't think of a single negative about the software, it's done so well.
##now, for the drawback i mentioned earlier in the review.
##finding a case with a screen protector for this phone that actually works, and doesn't impede the use of the screen is kinda impossible because of the curved screen, even otter box doesn't have on that works.
##you can always buy one of the wallet type cases to cover the screen, it'll help avoiding damage.
##of course if a screen protector isnt a big deal for you then you're golden.
##the phone does have the latest and greatest gorilla glass 5 on it so scratches really aren't an issue i've noticed zero on my phone.
##the wallet case i have on my phone has held up well and protected my phone from a couple of drops i'll be reviewing that shortly.
##i don't count this against the phone because this isn't really big deal to me but it might be to you, at the end of the day this phone is incredible and if your in the market for a phone the s8 should be at the top of your list.

[t]Galaxy S8 Screen Problem
##beware as the screen on the galaxy s8 is very, very fragile.
##i had a proper rubber case and a screen protector but the screen cracked completely with a small drop.
##figuring out how to get the screen replaced is a challenge, but when i finally got through to the right person it turns out that, as this is an international model, it can only be repaired back in the country of origin... which, even if i was so inclined, is a mystery to me.
##so, i have a brand new phone with a wrecked screen and no way forward to get it fixed.
##if i liked the phone more, i might try to jump through additional hoops but it's really not particularly good.
##okay, but not great.
##be warned, if you buy one also buy the thickest, heftiest possible protective case and hope for the best, because if the screen breaks - a high probability - you're out of luck.

##and all of this was set up in under 5 minutes on a sunday morning.

[t]The most fragile Galaxy Ever.
##it's been less than a month since i bought my samsung galaxy s8.
##and this phone is more fragile than samuel jackson on the movie "unbreakable".
##i committed the biggest mistake of my life when i decided to get rid of my google pixel xl phone.
##it is like ending your relationship with your legitimate girlfriend to date a prostitute.
##i used to be a big fan of samsung galaxy phones.
##(bought google's galaxy nexus, samsung galaxy s2, note 3, note 5) they were strong phones.
##now that i bought my galaxy s8 it fell on the soft carpet on the floor and the screen shattered.
##now i regret purchasing this phone, but it is good to learn from our mistakes.
##:d and this is the last samsung product i ever purchase on the rest of my life.
##i will give lg brand products a chance to be part of my life.
[t]Five Stars
##love it
[t]It was an used broken phone
##it was used and broken.
[t]The heavy weight champ
##i have not seen a smart phone camera yet that compares to the s8 main camera.
##it is without a doubt the best camera in a smart phone i've ever seen to date.
##the pics it can take are amazing and just as good as my $5000 camera i use for professional photography.
##it blows away apple in my opinion, yes apple has some decent phones but iso is not quite a computer if you ask me they can't be plugged into any pc without having to download itunes which comes with malware that you don't know your installing on your pc and can damage some pc's.
##it also installs some other apps you don't know your getting that can cause serious issues with system settings in the pc if its not an apple.
##any android can be plugged into any pc without a problem with no software to clog up your pc.
##the processor is killer,4 gig of ram!
##and i was sold on the camera immediately.
##being in a dark room or outside at night the pictures are crystal clear and can be adjusted with the pro setting it can take some time to figure out if you are not a photographer but still very user friendly.the battery is ok but if you don't have a app killer constantly killing background apps it will drain your battery pretty quick.
##but this can be controlled, power battery is my most recommended app killer that keeps apps closed and keeps tabs on the battery.
##it really does not need any cleaner apps since one is built in.
##i can't wait for the s9 to come out they are both going to be around the same price?
##the s8 and s9 at least for a while.
##i give the s8 5 stars!!

[t]How to fix broken glass screen
##i bought my s8 phone somewhere else, but the #1 issue with this phone is that it is the most fragile phone in existence.
##a 1 foot drop can shatter the screen or back glass.
##they might have fixed the glass in later models but if they didn't it is fixable!
##go to ebay and search for galaxy s8  screen replacement.
##make sure it is not just a glass screen protector.
##it should come with a set of tools to replace your screen and/ or back.
##basically you'll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone.
##the kit comes with new glue.
##search youtube for how to videos.
##you will have to unscrew the back and disconnect several connectors.
##if you do not think you can do it cell phone repair shops can fix this phone for you.
##the kit is only $25 on ebay,  i don't know what shops charge.
##you can rest easy now, don't be afraid of literally bricking your phone

[t]Simply the (almost)Best
##the samsung galaxy s8 is the simply the best phone you can buy in 2017. i have long been an apple fan but when galaxy s8 was released, that quickly changed.
##now i have my hands on, i can simply say this is almost perfect.
##why did i say almost?
##that is because while this design is the future, this phone has it's flaws widely mentioned in many review videos.
##the biggest being the fingerprint scanner location but that can be neglected as time passes and you get used with the phone.
[t]Almost Perfect phone
##for those of you that are consider buying this phone, let me mention some common variation of this phone: sm-g955f: international version, samsung exynos processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for gsm carriers sm-g955fd: international version, duel sim card, samsung exynos processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for gsm carriers sm-g955u: us version, snap dragon processor (supposedly better graphic support for gaming), i see people said the unlocked version support both gsm and cdma carriers, but i do not have this version and have not verify this myself.
##above are for s8+, s* is similar, part number replaced 955 with 950, with smaller screen and battery power.
##i used sm-g955fd:for about a month now, this is the most expensive phone i purchased.
##below is my list of pro and con.
##pro: decent camera, good with low light environment.
##great battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone i had in the past.
##support wireless charging, water-proof.
##less overheating.
##it gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold.
##con: unusual screen ratio.
##most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market.
##this also make it more difficult to type, i often press wrong key by accident due to spacing.
##overall, i think this is a good phone.
##best buy is offering a lot of promotion on this phone right now so you might wish to shop around before choosing where to buy it.

[t]Screen cracked in 3 days - design is flawed!
##i've had just about every samsung galaxy phone since s2.
##loved it.
##always a step ahead of apple and i liked the flexibility of android.
##bought s8 and i had to say it is the worst galaxy i've owned.
##the main issue is screen that cracks so easily.
##i didn't even drop the phone, i sat down and it was in my pocket, and the little bump of the phone caused the screen to crack.
##in a few more days i got a few more cracks.
##there is absolutely no value in the "infinity" screen, it's beautiful but worthless.
##in my 8 years of owning multiple galaxies i only cracked the screen once, and i dropped it many times.
##s8 has a design flaw.
##then there's samsung bloatware that annoys the hell out of you.
##bixby is useless but you can't disable it.
##it wakes up when a button is pressed accidentally in your pocket and it starts making noises, sometimes launching apps... what a piece of garbage!
##samsung keyboard and speech recognition is much worse than google's but they enable it by default.

[t]Be careful: Screen cracks on first little drop!
##be aware, the phone's screen will crack on the first drop, even if you use a case and screen protector.
##unfortunately it happened to me just as it apparently has happened to many other users (if you google galaxy s8 cracked screen, you will find many results)  so even though all the rest of the phone is outstanding, i would never ever buy it again as it will not even last even a month.
##my biggest concern is that repairing a cracked screen costs 200-300 usd and that i know i would have to repair it again just a few weeks later.
##of course, i have tried to be very careful, but due to the full glass body of the phone, it is extremely slippery and will slip out your pocket and fall of any surface very quickly and easily.
##i have been a faithful samsung customer for many years, but unfortunately i will probably not have a choice but need to look for a high end smartphone of lg, sony or htc now.
##ps: the stunning edge-glass-infinity-screen design is the cause of this deal braking problem.
##i guess one has to decide between the most beautiful and most breakable phone, or an a little bit less beautiful but more robust phone.
[t]Screen sucks, doesn't take a standard USB charging port.
##seriously, don't buy this phone.
##the bubble screen just makes finding a good, and sturdy screen protector on it difficult.
##it's just an ascetic thing and adds nothing to the phone.
##secondly it doesn't take a standard micro usb port.
##there's a reason people buy android phones, to stay away from stupid niche's like that.
##the side bar app thing they show as a selling point is also pointless, it's another stupid feature they add to make this phone "look" like they've added something new from the older phones.
##but in reality it's just the same as having certain apps in a folder on your wallpaper.
##don't waste your money on this phone, don't let samsung think that it's ok to make people buy certain chargers just so they can get extra money from you or leave your screen vulnerable to damages so you have to buy insurance on it, or a new phone.

##the curved screen provides no benefits that i have noticed, in fact it has been a hindrance on numerous occasions.
##the cuvre prevents you from accessing the time bar on some video player when in full screen, making rewinding or fast forwarding a hassle.
##the phone also features a useless assistant named bixby with its own dedicated button located directly below the volume controls.
##this frequently causes bixby to accidently open, closing whatever app you were using, whenever you attempt to adjust the volume.
##overall a huge disappointment and an overall frustrating device to use
[t]Awesome great phone
##awesome great phone!
##came new.
##came about 4 days early.
##i live in okinawa japan and it does not work with au but works with softbank.
##my complaints about the phone is the speaker ( only using the bottom facing speaker.)
##and the bluetooth 5.0 .
##i think its worse than the older types of bluetooth but split audio is really nice.
##pictures and videos are alot nicer than the iphone 7 plus and it has a audio port for all your wired devices.
##no regrets buying this phone.

##its not unlocked :(
[t]Just OK, several kludge features including bad button placement
##i have progressed from the s6 through the s7 and now to the s8.
##the s8 is just ok compared to the s7 based on my experience.
##i really do not like the fact that they took away the home button.
##it is so convenient to use it to activate the screen.
##the current design is a kludge.
##the buttons for volume and for bixby are almost directly opposite to the power button.
##this is the worst design ever.
##as a result, trying to turn off the screen is an extreme pain and usually results in a photo of my hand or activating bixby or changing the volume.
##my old iphone had a good design, with the power button on top.
##i'd have moved back to apple, but can't stand the restrictions, like on managing music.
##the phone is a bit faster than the s7, but i have trouble with it responding to my touch.
##that could be a symptom of the screen protector causing interference though.
##i am not a fan of the curved edges, preferring the flat screen.
##the display quality is great.
##the fingerprint scanner is inconvenient, but i knew that was the case going into this phone.

##this is a beautiful phone.
##i definitely wanted to experience something small but with a larger screen.
##a lot of people complain about the  location of the fingerprint scanner, which does  take some getting used to.
##but keep in mind that this is actually a natural position to place the scanner.
##hold whatever phone you have in your hand and really think about where you place your fingers and how you are holding your device.
##see what i mean?
##i found this new location much more convenient than using the scanner with my thumb on the front of my phone.
##unfortunately, there was something i couldn't get past with this particular model.
##the edges are more pronounced and cause a plastic-y looking glare when in the sunlight.
##i almost switched back to my iphone 7 plus, but after using the s8 for a few days, it felt, and looked, old and clunky!
##if you are used to bigger phones, upgrade to the plus.
##if you've never had a super large phone, the s8 would be perfect for you!
##also, please note that the orchid gray doesn't stand out as much indoors, as it appears much darker.
##when you're outside, the color stands out a lot more.
##update: after spending 3-4 days with the s8 plus, i ended up switching back to the s8.
##the verizon reps were super helfpul in assisting me throughout this process!
[t]bad phone
##bought from samsung.
##samsung messed up my order.
##the phone itself has buggy software, locks up or has lagging graphics, even for the most basic things.
##it's also very easy to slip off your hand.
##the on-screen home button sucks.
[t]5 Stars for the Galaxy S8
##my favorite phone ever.
##i got the straight talk version cause i don't like contracts but it's fantastic.
##this is the best galaxy phone ever.
##last one i had was a galaxy s5 but the s8 makes the s5 poor in comparison.
##i didn't know a phone could have such beautiful sound and graphics and great quality.
##i have wanted the s8 for a long time and just recently bought one, 3 days ago in fact and i absolutely love it.
##i ordered a clear case just cause i don't want to cover up the beauty of this phone.

##wow this is a hideously tiny narrow phone, i like samsung and this phone is so depressing to open im sening right back terrible tiny wow seriously id think about it evennif it was 200 or less i wouldnt buy it .. i currently have the amazon moto g4 but missed samsung i had very first galaxy captivate 8 years or so ago then had the 4 and wow the 8 is a huge let down ... samsung step up or your going to force me to apple products i have always avoided  cant believe how poor of size this phone is sad.

[t]Defective phone, Never order from them again
##never buy from thecoos again, wanted an international phone, so i can travel from usa to other places, once the phone arrived, tried t run it on, but noticed the buttons are not pressing like they should be, and secondly, i tried to open the sim card, but it was not opening with the pin, noticing that it must of have been glued shut, also tried to charge the phone, but it was not working as the cable was very loose and not staying put.
##then i noticed that the phone was just a defective phone, paying 600$ was just a waste for this junky phone.

[t]Worst Customer Service Ever
##so, let me start off by saying that i really did love my expereince overall with this phone.
##it's fast, pretty, and top of it's class.
##that was until one day, my phone began to crash randomly throughout the day.
##i thought maybe it just needed a reset, so i did just that.
##the problem persisted yet, so i have samsung a call, and this is where my experience with samsung was shot down, strangled, and ground into dust.
##it began with my first couple customer calls, i followed all of their data reset regulations and yet the issues were still going on.
##so, they stated i needed to send the phone in and have it looked at and fixed before they could do anything else (which was totally fine with me the first time).
##i asked them about a loaner phone while mine is repaired, and they stated that my carrier provides that and they do not.
##so, i called my carrier and they stated that samsung provides that and they do not.
##very frustrated with that i called back and was told samsung could not do anything, so i was stuck with a hand me down iphone, but it is just a temporary phone, right?...wrong!
##but ill get to that later.
##after waiting the 1.5 weeks to have my phone repaired and sent back i smiled as i opened the box and restored my phone, finally i could just get back to using it again.
##skip ahead 12 hours when the issue is still happening!
##so i message there online care center using there online chat and there service representative informs me that if it is not working again, they will most likely get me an exchange device.
##they tell me to call the executive care staff, but in order to get to them you must speak with their first level of customer service every single time!
##no matter what you tell them or who's name you drop they always need the whole story and waste 30 minutes of your day before informing you that they need to escalate you to their executive customer care department (no lie, this happened to me every time i called until i stated i refuse to talk to them).
##now, after that i spoke with a executive care assistant (eca).
##they informed me that the person who told me that i could get an exchange was wrong and that there needs to be multiple repairs on a device before it can be exchanged and that it needs to be sent in again!
##frustrated with the broken guarantee i asked to speak with a supervisor, the supervisor stated the same stuff that the eca said but did state she could get me expedited shipping (woohoo...).
##so again i packed my device and drove to a ups and dropped it off, dreadfully sliding my sim card back into that iphone.
##this time it only took 1.2 weeks (wow, what a difference) to get my phone back, and upon looking at the service receipt i noticed there was nothing marked as to what they performed, shrugging i thought maybe they just forgot.
##i restored my phone once more and yet again, it crashes not even 1 hour later.
##so a little peeved i call again (and go through the 30 minutes of the first representative :d) and after speaking with the eca she states that it looks like they did a software update (rightttttttt) and then sent it back.
##i inform her that it is still having these issues, she then informed me that it still does not qualify for an exchange because there was not anything repaired the last time i sent it.
##trying to control myself i ask her if there are any other options aside from sending it in again for weeks.
##she states sadly no and that she has no idea if i will ever be able to actually get an exchange or refund because it has to meet "repair criteria", again i angrily pack my phone up and ship it, waiting another 2 weeks to get my phone again because of the holidays.
##so i open the package when i get it back and don't even reset the piece of crap iphone because i knew that it was going to happen once more.
##i guess right!
##the phone crashed again and again.
##so i call once more and this is were i just refuse to speak to the 1st level of help, sensing my frustration and probably looking back at my last couple notes they pass me along.
##finally i am offered the exchange i wanted from november 2017. mind you it is now the end of january!
##i give them all the information, give them all my receipts (which i luckily still had) and they stated they will email me with a shipping label and directions.
##so, i wait yet another week for them to contact me, puzzled i call them and they stated they have nothing in their system about an exchange.
##taking a nice cleansing breath i try to not explode on this poor representative who can surely tell that i am not happy.
##at this point i demand a refund, the representative tries to persuade me otherwise but at this point i would never want to deal with this ever again if i have an issue down the road.
##so, she states that she will start the refund process, around 1.5 hours later she states it has been submitted and i will receive info within 2-3 business days.
##so, giving them a break i wait the full 3 days, and guess what?
##still no emails or calls.
##i call again and i informed that they having nothing in their system about a refund, just information about an exchange.
##i laugh into the phone and say they must be joking, the eca stated she is very sorry but they have no record and we must restart the process once more.
##i swallow my anger, trying to be a sensible and caring man and begin this 2 hour process once more, and this eca gives me her direct line and email after the process is finished and states she will email me with updates to ensure that i get it done in a timely manner.
##so, i send my phone in once again!
##and this is in february at this point!
##waiting a couple of days and not hearing anything i just email her, asking for an update, no answer!
##i try again a day later, and no answer once again.
##i give her direct line a call 2 times in 1 day and leave a kind message just asking for an update.
##two days later i have yet to hear anything.
##so i call there eca department once more and i am told that it can take 7-14 business days or 7-21 regular days for a refund to be issued.
##i tell them it has been nearly 2 weeks since my 1st attempt and over 1 week since i sent the device in and they just tell me that it is pending and i need to wait.
##so, i wait another 4 days, still no updates from anyone, my package tracking has been at there warehouse for over a week now because i can see it on ups's website.
##i call very upset and speak to yet another eca, he stated that he is sorry, and was confused as to why they have had it a week and why it was still pending.
##he informs me that the process has yet to even start.
##at this point i am frustrated yet again and demand to speak to a supervisor, he tries to tell me they can't do anything special, but at this point i need to let someone know my frustrations with this whole process.
##so, he transfers me and upon someone picking up they just hang up on me.
##so, i call again and i am told by the 1st level that the eca told them that they have done all they can for me at this moment and that i need to wait (uh no, i am speaking to someone about this because at this point i deserve to be listened to), i wait on hold for over an hour to speak to the 1st level supervisor who literally picks up and tells me that she just needed to see what was wrong before she could transfer me.
##so, she transfers me and i wait another 45 minutes before speaking to the eca supervisor.
##he tells e he is sorry and that he would personally email the refunds/exchange department to have my refund "expedited" i ask him to let me speak to them because it has been over 2.5 weeks since my initial call and i am paying for a phone that i haven't been able to use for months now.
##he informs me that they do not take calls and they can only be contacted by eca through emails.
##frustrated i hold my tongue and ask him for his direct line and email, he gives it to me and tells me to call him for any questions or updates and that the refund'exchange dept should get back to him that day and he would let me know their response.
##nothing comes that day, or the next, or that week!
##so, i try to call that supervisor, no answer and i leave a message, no response 2 days later.
##i call yet again and jump through the hurdles and hoops, i am told that they are having issues with their computer system and that their accounting dept was closed the day before and that my refund is still pending (what?!?!)
##i laugh yet again (because at this point i am just so shocked at how horrible this service is) and i am informed that i need to call again in 24 hours to see where it is at.
##at this point i am on day 19 of the 21 days they guaranteed (although from all the false guarantees i have gotten from them, i doubt it will be on time).
##i inform the eca of this and she asks me to just be patient and "they are doing their best".
##i still have yet to get my money back, i am still paying for this phone which i literally have not been able to use since november.
##i have wasted hours of time speaking to this company and their service is so poor i can safely say that samsung will not be a brand in my life or my families life.
##i hope that someone from this company gets to see this and fixes the issues.
##i hope that someone considering buying this phone reads this and takes into account what will happen if an issue arises.
##a multi- billion dollar company should not be making a customer jump though hoop after hoop to resolve a mistake the company made.
##i just want to state that i normally am very understanding of mistakes and i have a great deal of patience for human error.
##but when a mistake happens over and over and when a promise is broken nearly every time there comes a point when your experience needs to be shared and the issue needs to be resolved.
##i also know that this is just a phone and that the world has way worse issues, but i am a working father who doesn't have the extra time or money to buy a new phone after the device given to me was defective.
##i hope this is helpful to people and thanks for listening to my rant!

##i tried so many "flagship"phones that past year trying to replace my s6 edge!
##from sony xperia xz to htc 10, until i found the note 7, too bad it was recalled, went on the hunt again, or was it then that i got the xz?, anyway ended up with the google pixel, which though very good, still felt like an unfinished product compared to the note.
##back to this s8 here.
##i'm gonna just mention the basics, coz i see so many in depth reviews here, so if ur confused about any phone compared to this one, feel free to comment on my review, i'll try to answer from experience!
##- the edge to edge screen is amazing, put it next to any phone out there and it stands out.
##i really can't stop looking at it because it's so sharp!
##any picture, movie, youtube video looks just better on this screen.
##- the camera is just great!
##while the pixel was advertised as the best camera on a phone, i still think this s8 is a little better.
##- games and apps run fluently on this phone, no lags whatsoever, this phone will run anything u throw at, no sweat.
##- the size is just perfect, and the weight too!
##it feels as big as my google pixel but with twice the screen size (not exact measures if ur one of those! )
##iwas gonna get the s8 plus, but felt it was oddly too tall and the width wasn't just adequate to the length, but the s8 is just the perfect size, easier with one hand too.
##-the battery is nothing special, i can say i'm an above average user and it lasts almost all day.
##obviously when u play more or watch more netflix, on that gorgeous screen, u'll need to charge it twice, but on most days i didn't need to.
##you'll not regret getting that phone, definitely the best on the market right now.
##i absolutely it love it and i think you will too!

[t]a pretty "status symbol" phone with lots of disappointments.
##my first android was a oneplus one.
##then, a one plus two.
##i have zero complaints about these two phones.
##the screen on my op2 cracked, so i decided to splurge and got myself this beauty.
##in retrospect, i should have just repaired my op2's screen.
##the s8 was an absolute (and expensive) disappointment.
##it gives you gimmicky features such as the iris-scan, the heart-rate monitor, edge-lighting, which are honestly a bit useless, in my opinion.
##the curved screen, while a novelty, is incredibly pointless, and in fact creates glare at the edges which makes it very hard to see notifications when the phone is mounted in your car.
##a lot of people are annoyed about the finger-print scanner's location.
##it's not ideal, but i've tolerated it and it seems to work okay for me.
##android purists will not be happy with the fact that samsung tries to force their "google now" clone called "bixby" onto the user.
##it is a complete reinvention of the wheel and does not work nearly as well as "google now" does.
##they have even dedicated a button to this abomination and have made sure that it cannot be re-mapped to do anything else.
##a truly annoying restriction on the user who paid a lot of money to have a customizable phone - otherwise, i would have gotten an iphone, had i wanted to be locked into a certain way of doing things.
##some very common widgets (such as google keep) simply don't display correctly on this phone.
##they display perfectly fine on other android phones, but not on this, possibly due to the aspect ratio.
##the all-white theme that is forced upon the user is not only an eye-sore, it makes notifications indistinguishable from one another.
##ultimately, the phone is nothing more than a status symbol and yes, it's pretty.
##the display and camera are nice, but that's not something lacking in most modern phones.
##please save your money and get something else.
[t]Poor service
##product i received is defective continuously drops signal and is not registering to the network even though it is the international version and i am using in jamaica, the bluetooth doesn't work either.
##the item was shipped to the us then brought to jamaica and now to send back the item i have to stand the charges which is stupid.
##reps provide contradicting information  i've always been a strong advocate and prime member for amazon but this experience changed everything.

##crappy device.

##muy buen producto.
[t]overcharged for delivery
##devise is good but they charged me $200 extra for delivery.
[t]Everything else about the phone is great.
##they said it was internationally unlocked and it wasn't.
##i tried it in jamaica and the phone was locked.everything else about the phone is great.
[t]Worst. Phone. Ever.
##okay.
##first one broke second day of use, right in the morning!
##first drop, concrete, shattered - and one small crack = dead phone.
##because the darn thing is needlessly entirely glass, and virtually no edges, any cracks splinter across the whole phone.
##cracks in the middle (mine was only on the right "infinity" edge area) cripple all touch sensors above the middle, so i could only dial numbers, not use the keypad even trying to get the phone fixed.
##the insurance company refuses to replace these; they found every excuse to prevent me getting a replacement for 10 days!
##i demanded sprint make it right, but, as nice as sprint support is, the insurance company they use is a bag of d's.
##rude!
##they even accused me in the end of phone insurance fraud.
##wtf!?
##so i left sprint for t-mobile on principal and paid the remaining $700 balance for the still dead phone.
##second phone (first with tmobile) survived about a week and a half.
##it was about the second drop, just about 2 feet off the ground in a protective case!
##looking at it right now.
##i knew all phone carriers have the same insurance, so i've decided to just get a samsung j7; basically a note 4 without the stylus.
##since i'm looking at my note 4, which as slight scratches on the screen, and some metal ripped off the side from drops, it still works perfectly, i'm glad to have a cheaper phone i don't mind so much  breaking, and will eventually file a claim with tmobile, once i can stomach the concept of dealing with that insurance company again.
##i love samsung, but i hate this phone!
##it's only brought me misery, and $1400 dollars down the toilet.
##also, side note, no current phone repair places can fix this, because of the "inifinity" screen junk,
[t]Not recomend.
##over priced phone not worth have price, nathing special battery sucks compared to huawei mate 9, colors not real, camera average.
[t]Don't waste your money
##this is the worst phone i've ever had.
##i had a screen protector and case on it and the screen shattered really bad when i dropped it.
##i dropped my s5 all the time and it was always fine.
##this breaks ridiculously easy.
##the screen being so big and on the sides makes stuff open all the time that you don't want to open.
##i'm getting rid of it and getting a cheap phone.
##huge waste of money.

[t]Another Samsung Failure
##before you buy this phone, read reviews on the durability of the screen.
##there is no question whether or not you will break your screen.
##it will break.
##my screen broke after 2 weeks with both a screen protector and case on the phone.
##the s8 has the most fragile screen of any smartphone ever.
##don't believe me?
##google it.
##do not purchase this phone.
##samsung tried to make up for their last failure and just made something equally terrible.
##there is no way that this screen is made of gorilla glass.
##my lg screen never broke, and i dropped it off of a 10 foot ladder onto concrete.

##the s8 is a super phone!
##but like all things in life, it isn't perfect.
##it is fragile and a finger print magnet... but if you have been using other galaxy phones then this is no surprise to you.
##my biggest beef is with bixby!, i'm very disappointed that bixby is only half baked.
##shame on samsung for not having it ready by release and also for not letting you re-map the bixby button to something else.. the battery is o.k.
##but not great and for the money  i think the phone should have 6gs of ram.
##screen resolution automatically being set to the lower resolution tells me that samsung might still be a little gun shy because of what happened to the note 7. all in all i really like this phone but if you haven't got it yet you might want to wait to see what bixby is really like, that is if that sort of thing is important to you.
##**6/2/17 ** i had to come back to this and drop a star fro this review because as of today samsung still is not able to get bixby up and running in the u.s. i mean what good is a voice assistant device with no voice!!!
##they originally said it would be up and working in the spring and now they are delaying it again.
##this makes this phone a great beta device but definitely not ready for prime time!!
##it's like a great looking sports car that can t go past 70 miles per hour!!
##really!!!
##and they dedicated a button to something that they can't get to work!!
##i' starting to regret that i purchased this thing.

[t]Love this phone, HATE bixby
##i recently purchased this device not from amazon but from my local verizon store (i am here to review the device not the seller) , replacing my old galaxy s6 edge.
##in the past week or so i have fallen in love with this phone the extra little features are awesome.
##the finger print scanner on the back of the phone was a bit weird to me at first but now that i have gotten a bit more used to it i think it is a nice change.
##making it easier to unlock your phone as you take it out of your pocket.
##all in all the device deserves a 4/5.
##i will explain the reason i think it should get a 4/5 and there is only one issue.
##if i could give the the device a 4.5 i would but that is not how amazon works.
##i have one single complaint.
##the dedicated bixby button is probably the most annoying thing i have ever used.
##at first you could remap the button (i changed mine to the home key) but that change would be reverted within a day and you would then have to go remap the key again.
##just recently samsung removed the ability to do that because people were using google assistant instead of their own assistant bixby.
##since the ability has been removed i ended up having to find an app that made it so i could disable all of the 6 packages that is bixby.
##doing this removed all functionality of the dedicated button on the side of the device.
##it is really stupid to have a pointless button on the side of my phone, but at least i don't have to worry about accidentally pushing it and having an application that i do not want/ use show up on my screen.
[t]SAMSUNG  Coporation they need to test there s*** before sale on markeds.....

[t]WORST PHONE EVER
##buyer beware!
##worst phone ever!
[t]Exynos 8890/8895 vs Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
##any one want to buy samsung s8 or s8 plus should wait for the u.s. version with qualcomm 835 release which is may 31. qualcomm 835&adreno 540 are much better than exynos 8890/8895&mali-71.
##especially when you use cellphone to play 3d games.
##many games do not support mail gpu, like you use amd graphics to play large 3d games it will has a lot of problems such as reboot, not support anti-aliasing, cannot open in-game special effect.
##exynos is 14nm=8890, 10nm=8895 & 2.3+1.7ghz but qualcomm is 10nm & 2.35+1.9ghz, able to run at a higher frequency for more stable time.
##and the most important thing,the international version exynos 8890 or 8895 only support gsm unlock, but us version qualcomm 835 unlock the entire network cdma and gsm, meaning that you can use this phone at any network company in the world.
[t]Highly recommend it
##works great!
##haven't encounter any bugs or problems with software.
##had mines for almost a month with no hiccup or decrease in performance.
[t]Pretty much unusable holding it without a case
##pretty much unusable holding it without a case.
##it operates well but these edge phones require a case.
##case makers love the edge phones...

##what a gimmick for an upgrade.
[t]NO GOOD GPS
##i got a galaxy s8plus and iphone 7s .... i do traveling and the samsung s8+ disconnect must of the time .... y you use your smart phone as a gps samsung s8+ or any is not what you need  thanks
[t]Flashy phone, but poorly designed
##i preordered this phone, not knowing that it was an edge phone, since previous models of galaxies had the normal phones and edge phones separated.
##i was disappointed to see it was an edge phone since they're more susceptible to break, but i figured it was fine, and i got a case.
##one week after my phone arrived, it slipped from my lab, falling two feet to the stone floor, shattering my screen.
##never in the past eight years have i ever cracked a screen, and i cracked the s8 within a week.
##don't believe me?
##look up stress tests for the s8, and you'll see it performs worse compared to previous phones.
##pros: 1. nice camera 2. great battery life 3. tons of storage space  cons: 1. breaks far too easily 2. fingerprint scanner not located in a convenient location, and it usually takes ~10 tries to get the phone to even recognize my fingerprint.
##3. the virtual home buttons disappear in some apps, making it annoying to try to close the app quickly.
##4. there is an extra button added to this phone below the volume buttons for something called "bixby" which advertises itself as being some sort of virtual planner, providing the option to do an amazon search for something using image recognition.
##it's a cool concept, but i'm always pressing the button when i don't want to see it, and the image search feature is just a commercialized use of computer vision.
[t]Ask about installed firmware if you want SPay to work.
##the s8 version i received had panama firmware installed, some apps like samsung pay will not work until that country supports it, so if spay is a selling point then don't get the international version, or get an international version with firmware from a country the supports spay.
##other than that, no bloatware from carriers, at&t sim works fine.
##camera and screen is amazing, better battery life then my aging s6.
##usb type c is nice addition, and i can still get spay on a gear 3 smart watch, would be 5 stars if not for the spay region locks, still a great purchase.
[t]Great phone except the useless location of the fingerprint reader.
##great phone except one star shy of five because of the fingerprint reader only in the rear.
##as like many people, i am often unlocking the phone on a table surface.
##i don't hold it in my hand much of the time except when walking or making phone calls when moving around.
##i don't hold it often such as when sitting at a desk or dinner table.
##i have to pick it up and re-hold it a specific way to unlock it using fingerprint identification.
##not a feasible design.
##iris and face recognition are unreliable as a technology with different environments and lighting.
##i have to go back to the old fashion pin or easy-to-hack swipe to use the security on it.
##also should mention that the camera lens gets smeared up easily by having the fingerprint reader right next to it.
[t]Disappointing
##the phon was supposed to be factory unlocked and it isnt...i am extremely disappointed...i paid considerable money for the product and i didn't get what i asked for.

[t]I HATE THIS PHONE
##i hate this phone!!!!!
##it takes 20 hours to charge via usb-c on computer or car, it will only charge fast if connected to a wall, and takes 2 hours to charge.
##it also loses battery like crazy, after 15 min i'm down 5% doing nothing and only loaded 3 apps.
[t]performs great, amazing camera
##probably the most feature packed phone out right now.
##looks stunning, performs great, amazing camera, best screen on a smartphone hands down.
##i love the iris scanner which works flawlessly even in a fully dark room which amazes me.
##battery life has been great so far lasting me through a full day easily but i do have to charge it every night.
##charging this phone is not as fast as some other phones like oneplus 3, honor 8 or the axon 7. but you have wireless charging which makes up for it.
##the headphones included in the box are great as well.
##the fingerprint scanner location is not an issue for me, i have a case on and it's not difficult to reach but it does take some getting used to.
##the camera is also one of the best right up there with the google pixel.
##the sound is pretty good, not amazing like stereo speaker phones but its loud and clear enough.
##it's easy to use with one hand even though it has a huge 5.8-inch screen thanks to the new 18.5 by 9 screen aspect ratio and the 84% screen to body ratio.
[t]Excellent phone, beautiful aesthetics, and a taste of the future worth paying for: 9/10
##excellent phone, beautiful aesthetics, and a taste of the future worth paying for: 9/10.
##tl;dr gorgeous & futuristic phone, industry-leading screen, excellent and reliable (rear and front) camera, full-day battery, water and dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, and bluetooth 5.0!
##on the downside, it won't receive timely software updates, and fingerprint scanner location is a minor setback.
##it's hard to choose your next phone because there are so many good options today, and potentially good phones coming later this year (2017).
##by now you've probably seen a million reviews on the s8, but it doesn't make the decision easier.
##here's my suggestion, in two quick steps.
##make sure none of the cons below are deal-breakers for you.
##then, look over the list of unique advantages, and see if they get you excited enough to pay the hefty $750.
##if you're still here after that, then welcome to the club!
##be sure to check out my final tips for maximizing your s8 experience.
##cons: 1. edge screen is beautiful, but annoying in two situations.
##it creates visual distortions a little (less than s7 edge though).
##it is also difficult to hold the phone up in the air, face down (e.g.
##before sleep), as the phone is prone to accidentally registering side touches.
##a case remedies the latter problem, but i dislike putting a case on such a beautiful phone (see pro tip #1).
##2. samsung is not very good with software updates.
##if you take great pleasure from trying new android in a timely manner, this isn't for you -- the only two options are iphones and pixels.
##that said, keep in mind that new software updates typically slow down the phone.
##3. fingerprint scanner location has been mentioned a gazillion times.
##yes, i wish it was on the front.
##no, it really isn't that bad on an s8 (s8+ is a different story).
##you know, we have this thing called "muscle memory"..  it took me two days to adjust to the new location, and now i have no problems.
##if you really hate it, try facial recognition or iris scanner, they're very good (see pro tip #8) 4. the phone has glass back thats prone to cracking, so watch out if youre clumsy.
##but see pro tip #1 5. s8 doesnt have monster battery life, and it needs to be charged once a day.
##if you need to go past a day, look elsewhere.
##6. some are disappointed about a lack of dual-camera.
##personally, the rear camera is wide enough that i am rarely in a situation where i feel the need for a wide-angle lens (like in lg).
##an optical zoom would have been nice (like in iphone 7+), but not really an issue for me (see pro tip #6)  unique advantages 1. futuristic aesthetics of a bezelless all-screen phone.
##this doesnt really improve the functionality of the phone, but theres just something satisfying about this futuristic experience.
##2. the screen is just so damn beautiful, no contest here.
##always-on display is useful.
##3. as of today, its the only phone that checks all of my needs: excellent rear camera, excellent front camera (reviewers too often ignore this), water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro sd card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the s8, bluetooth 5.0!
##4. bluetooth 5.0 is amazing.
##s8 is a first phone to come with this, and its awesome.
##i frequently use the ability to connect to two different speakers at once, for a surround-sound like experience in my room.
##you can also listen to the same music with your friend in a library, by connecting to two different headphones.
##5. s8 is also the first phone to come with gigabit lte, which is nice for future-proofing the phone, but it doesn't quite help us yet.
##pro tips 1. consider getting a tempered-glass screen protector (theyre better on s8 than on s7 edge) and a slickwraps/dbrand skin for the back.
##the skins make your phone look unique, improves grip, and it also helps cover up cracks if youve dropped your phone.
##slickwraps frequently has discount promotions on their website, so watch out for that.
##dont use a case, enjoy the beautiful phone!
##2. bixby is useless, and if youre like me, most smart assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns.
##you can remap the bixby button (as of april 2017): see https://www.xda-developers.com/3-applications-bypass-bixby-restriction/ 3. general android tip: go to settings, developer options, set window/transition/animator animation scales to x0.5 to speed things up (google this if you dont know what i mean) 4. general amoled tip: take advantage of black wallpapers to save battery life 5. set screen resolution up to qhd.
##in my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use.
##going hd will significantly improve battery life if you are a heavy gamer, or use cpu intensive apps a lot.
##6. if you really miss dual-camera set-ups in other phones, consider getting a separate smartphone camera lens kit that sells for ~$20.
##theyre less convenient than a built-in dual lens, but on the upside theyre much more versatile and fun.
##7. if you are still not convinced whether to buy s8, then wait.
##most phones (except iphones and pixels) drop prices relatively quickly, and you may be able to snatch one up cheap refurbished in auction sites.
##8. contrary to some reviews, the facial recognition and the iris scanner are reliable and fast.
##in my experience, how you register your face/iris determines how effective it will be.
##if you wear glasses, register with glasses on.
##also, register under medium lighting conditions and not in extreme conditions.
##you want the phone to be able to recognize you under different environments.
##it's a really nice phone, highly recommended.
[t]Exactly as advertised. I was nervous due to lack of reviews, that's why I am putting this.
##sm950f upgrading from an s5 using straight talk bring your own phone.
##i did have to get the $59 pack from walmart but only used the nano sim to replace the existing sim that was too large, so i still have the service plan for next month.
##switching from one phone to another was a breeze using supplied cables and adapters.
##although it did transfer apps but not passwords, for example my wink hub app went over keeping all switches and routines but i had no clue what many of the passwords were.
##as i was dealing with a dead old phone i could just reset them via that before wiping it.
##the mains charger has european prongs but i have many usb wall chargers so no big deal.
##the factory headphones are worse than my $30 ones.
##but the phone itself is a dream compared to an s5.
##so much quicker and no lags
[t]Very disappointed
##bugs, bugs, bugs... from the pulldown notification menu not pulling down properly, to the extreme lack of screen touch sensitivity, im really wishing id have waited for the new iphone.
##very overpriced, very substandard...  still disappointed.
##i've had the phone a month and i've decided i am never buying another samsung product again.
##just got the update, no difference in user experience.
##we pay too much money for these things to keep getting crap.
##for what it's worth the iphone will be incredibly overpriced as well.
##we need a more relevant third option.
[t]Great Phone.
##solid performance, beautiful design, the latest processor as of 04/28/2017, bluetooth 5.0!
##they fixed the problem that i had with the galaxy s7 edge that i often accidently touched the edges of the screen, it doesn't happen with the "edges" of this screen anymore.
##i have a google pixel xl and i'm going to switch for the samsung galaxy s8, not the s8+, because even with my big hands i have to stretch my hand to be able to reach for the fingerprint sensor of the s8+.
##the screen of the s8 is even bigger than the google pixel xl by 2% already and the total size of the phone is smaller than the pixel xl.
##in terms of the software update, it's slower to be released than for the google pixel xl, but it's faster than for the carrier phones, like at&t, verizon, t-mobile, etc.
##you can't go wrong with this phone, in general terms, comparing all the features, pros and cons, it's the best in the market.
##pros: -design -wireless charging -latest processor -bluetooth 5.0 -mobile hdr premium technology -no problems (at least for me) in touching the edges of the screen accidently.
##-water/dust resistance ip68 -good battery optimization -usb type-c -headphones 3.5mm input -akg earbuds included -great quality camera -beautiful display (image) -usb type-c to usb adapter included -usb type-c to usb adapter included -pay safely virtually at any store with samsung pay (something that apple pay and android pay can't do) -comes already with android 7.0 nougat -expandable storage via microsd card.
##cons: -comes with 64gb of internal memory with no other options with more storage other than through the microsd card -no unlimited storage on the cloud for pictures and videos (like google pixel and pixel xl) -fingerprint in one of the worst places possible.
##-sound not that great with only one speaker (not stereo)
[t]Great phone and a fair price
##i didn't buy from amazon but i did get one from metro-pcs.
##i'm blown away by this phone and i've only had it about 2 days.
##first off let me say how great the battery life is.
##i'll provide a real life example of use.
##i took it off the charger at about 3pm on 4/27/17.
##i texted, watched videos, surfed the web for a few hours, played a high graphics game & live streamed on youtube for an hour and the phone is only at 50%.
##thats a lot of use for about 12 hours.
##i loved the s7 edge and this is everything and extra.
##the screen is outstanding and cant say enough good things about this phone.
##its exactly what you want out of a phone plus more.
##sure its a lot of money, but you're paying a good price for something simply amazing.
##if you have the cash, just buy it.
##it's well worth it.
[t]A Big Advancement Over Samsung's Previous Phones
##note: i am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.
##a quick prologue: i had been laying low since buying two samsung galaxy s6 edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, i loved it that much).
##i knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), i knew the s7 edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward.
##so i bought my s6 edges with the thought in mind that i would have it for at least 2-3 years.
##my analysis was that samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. i gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies.
##fast forward to this year, and i have not been wrong - samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020).
##with the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of hdr technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.
##i loved my s6 edges, but i got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a rose gold iphone 6s last year, while keeping the white s6 edge.
##i loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light.
##if you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my s6 edge.
##it is so good i have replaced my travel dslr with it (i still use my canon 5d mark iii for my serious projects), and all my instagram photos are also from my s6 edge (you can find the link to my ig on my amazon profile).
##sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the s8 is even better.
##do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the s7 edge.
##it is not the same.
##it is a new camera system developed by sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains hdr and selective focus elements/photo modes.
##it excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the s7 edge's camera.
##it might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps sony camera in its new xperia x phones, but for everyday use, i feel this is the best phone camera so far.
##it has electronic image stabilization (eis), even up to 4k video recording, which is a first for phone cameras.
##the front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13mp camera of the lg g6.
##this is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but i know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that.
##the resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi.
##the technology is samsung's very own oled, called samoled.
##it is the same basic technology that makes the best tv screens in lg's oled tvs.
##samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever.
##you can read more technical specs from display mate:  displaymate.
##com/galaxy_s8_shootout_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)  how samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well.
##instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on a 18:5.9 ratio, which just sounds really weird.
##this is pretty much a 3:1 ratio, which is quite unheard of.
##even lg's unique g6 phone has a different 18:9 (or 2:1) ratio.
##so this is samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year).
##i really don't know why they chose this ratio, as even cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio.
##so there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all s8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels.
##this phone is actually more narrow than the s6/s6 edge.
##the s8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the s6 edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. but as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier.
##so although the s8 has a total footprint that is larger than the s6 edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand.
##for further comparisons, the iphone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iphone 7 plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the lg g6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g).
##so it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iphone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the s8).
##the sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones.
##however, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as htc's usual dual-speakers.
##speaking of earphones, a pair of premium akg earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones i have witnessed.
##it cannot compare to my velodynes and sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones.
##that reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included vr headset, also includes a samsun 256gb microsd card, and a pair of akg bluetooth headphones.
##each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch:<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/akg-bluetooth-headphone-black-y50btblk/dp/b01bx72ruy/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">akg bluetooth headphone black (y50btblk)</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/samsung-evo-256gb-uhs-i-microsdxc-u3-memory-card-with-adapter-mb-mc256da-am/dp/b01jngcwhu/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">samsung evo+ 256gb uhs-i microsdxc u3 memory card with adapter (mb-mc256da/am)</a>.
##my s6 edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month.
##but even with the top processor of the time, and 3gb of ram, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up.
##the camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second.
##the s8, with its 4gb of ram and either the qualcomm snapdragon 835 processor or samsung's own exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job.
##the snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since i feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor.
##i think once we reach 6gb of ram, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.
##in totality, this is the first phone since the s6 edge that i got really excited about, and with the rumored oled iphone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade.
##if you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the samsung galaxy s8.
##it is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out....
[t]Five Stars
##nice phone
[t]Great Nintendo for the Grandson!
##i love the new nintendo.
##great button feel and colors for my grandson.
##would definitely recommend for other people looking for gifts for their grandkids!
##glad i finally found one on amazon, these were too hard to find at target and wal-mart.
[t]I HATE THIS PHONE
##i hate this phone!!!!!
##it takes 20 hours to charge via usb-c on computer or car, it will only charge fast if connected to a wall, and takes 2 hours to charge.
##it also loses battery like crazy, after 15 min i'm down 5% doing nothing and only loaded 3 apps.
[t]performs great, amazing camera
##probably the most feature packed phone out right now.
##looks stunning, performs great, amazing camera, best screen on a smartphone hands down.
##i love the iris scanner which works flawlessly even in a fully dark room which amazes me.
##battery life has been great so far lasting me through a full day easily but i do have to charge it every night.
##charging this phone is not as fast as some other phones like oneplus 3, honor 8 or the axon 7. but you have wireless charging which makes up for it.
##the headphones included in the box are great as well.
##the fingerprint scanner location is not an issue for me, i have a case on and it's not difficult to reach but it does take some getting used to.
##the camera is also one of the best right up there with the google pixel.
##the sound is pretty good, not amazing like stereo speaker phones but its loud and clear enough.
##it's easy to use with one hand even though it has a huge 5.8-inch screen thanks to the new 18.5 by 9 screen aspect ratio and the 84% screen to body ratio.
[t]Excellent phone, beautiful aesthetics, and a taste of the future worth paying for: 9/10
##excellent phone, beautiful aesthetics, and a taste of the future worth paying for: 9/10.
##tl;dr gorgeous & futuristic phone, industry-leading screen, excellent and reliable (rear and front) camera, full-day battery, water and dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, and bluetooth 5.0!
##on the downside, it won't receive timely software updates, and fingerprint scanner location is a minor setback.
##it's hard to choose your next phone because there are so many good options today, and potentially good phones coming later this year (2017).
##by now you've probably seen a million reviews on the s8, but it doesn't make the decision easier.
##here's my suggestion, in two quick steps.
##make sure none of the cons below are deal-breakers for you.
##then, look over the list of unique advantages, and see if they get you excited enough to pay the hefty $750.
##if you're still here after that, then welcome to the club!
##be sure to check out my final tips for maximizing your s8 experience.
##cons: 1. edge screen is beautiful, but annoying in two situations.
##it creates visual distortions a little (less than s7 edge though).
##it is also difficult to hold the phone up in the air, face down (e.g.
##before sleep), as the phone is prone to accidentally registering side touches.
##a case remedies the latter problem, but i dislike putting a case on such a beautiful phone (see pro tip #1).
##2. samsung is not very good with software updates.
##if you take great pleasure from trying new android in a timely manner, this isn't for you -- the only two options are iphones and pixels.
##that said, keep in mind that new software updates typically slow down the phone.
##3. fingerprint scanner location has been mentioned a gazillion times.
##yes, i wish it was on the front.
##no, it really isn't that bad on an s8 (s8+ is a different story).
##you know, we have this thing called "muscle memory"..  it took me two days to adjust to the new location, and now i have no problems.
##if you really hate it, try facial recognition or iris scanner, they're very good (see pro tip #8) 4. the phone has glass back thats prone to cracking, so watch out if youre clumsy.
##but see pro tip #1 5. s8 doesnt have monster battery life, and it needs to be charged once a day.
##if you need to go past a day, look elsewhere.
##6. some are disappointed about a lack of dual-camera.
##personally, the rear camera is wide enough that i am rarely in a situation where i feel the need for a wide-angle lens (like in lg).
##an optical zoom would have been nice (like in iphone 7+), but not really an issue for me (see pro tip #6)  unique advantages 1. futuristic aesthetics of a bezelless all-screen phone.
##this doesnt really improve the functionality of the phone, but theres just something satisfying about this futuristic experience.
##2. the screen is just so damn beautiful, no contest here.
##always-on display is useful.
##3. as of today, its the only phone that checks all of my needs: excellent rear camera, excellent front camera (reviewers too often ignore this), water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro sd card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the s8, bluetooth 5.0!
##4. bluetooth 5.0 is amazing.
##s8 is a first phone to come with this, and its awesome.
##i frequently use the ability to connect to two different speakers at once, for a surround-sound like experience in my room.
##you can also listen to the same music with your friend in a library, by connecting to two different headphones.
##5. s8 is also the first phone to come with gigabit lte, which is nice for future-proofing the phone, but it doesn't quite help us yet.
##pro tips 1. consider getting a tempered-glass screen protector (theyre better on s8 than on s7 edge) and a slickwraps/dbrand skin for the back.
##the skins make your phone look unique, improves grip, and it also helps cover up cracks if youve dropped your phone.
##slickwraps frequently has discount promotions on their website, so watch out for that.
##dont use a case, enjoy the beautiful phone!
##2. bixby is useless, and if youre like me, most smart assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns.
##you can remap the bixby button (as of april 2017): see https://www.xda-developers.com/3-applications-bypass-bixby-restriction/ 3. general android tip: go to settings, developer options, set window/transition/animator animation scales to x0.5 to speed things up (google this if you dont know what i mean) 4. general amoled tip: take advantage of black wallpapers to save battery life 5. set screen resolution up to qhd.
##in my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use.
##going hd will significantly improve battery life if you are a heavy gamer, or use cpu intensive apps a lot.
##6. if you really miss dual-camera set-ups in other phones, consider getting a separate smartphone camera lens kit that sells for ~$20.
##theyre less convenient than a built-in dual lens, but on the upside theyre much more versatile and fun.
##7. if you are still not convinced whether to buy s8, then wait.
##most phones (except iphones and pixels) drop prices relatively quickly, and you may be able to snatch one up cheap refurbished in auction sites.
##8. contrary to some reviews, the facial recognition and the iris scanner are reliable and fast.
##in my experience, how you register your face/iris determines how effective it will be.
##if you wear glasses, register with glasses on.
##also, register under medium lighting conditions and not in extreme conditions.
##you want the phone to be able to recognize you under different environments.
##it's a really nice phone, highly recommended.
[t]Exactly as advertised. I was nervous due to lack of reviews, that's why I am putting this.
##sm950f upgrading from an s5 using straight talk bring your own phone.
##i did have to get the $59 pack from walmart but only used the nano sim to replace the existing sim that was too large, so i still have the service plan for next month.
##switching from one phone to another was a breeze using supplied cables and adapters.
##although it did transfer apps but not passwords, for example my wink hub app went over keeping all switches and routines but i had no clue what many of the passwords were.
##as i was dealing with a dead old phone i could just reset them via that before wiping it.
##the mains charger has european prongs but i have many usb wall chargers so no big deal.
##the factory headphones are worse than my $30 ones.
##but the phone itself is a dream compared to an s5.
##so much quicker and no lags
[t]Very disappointed
##bugs, bugs, bugs... from the pulldown notification menu not pulling down properly, to the extreme lack of screen touch sensitivity, im really wishing id have waited for the new iphone.
##very overpriced, very substandard...  still disappointed.
##i've had the phone a month and i've decided i am never buying another samsung product again.
##just got the update, no difference in user experience.
##we pay too much money for these things to keep getting crap.
##for what it's worth the iphone will be incredibly overpriced as well.
##we need a more relevant third option.
[t]Great Phone.
##solid performance, beautiful design, the latest processor as of 04/28/2017, bluetooth 5.0!
##they fixed the problem that i had with the galaxy s7 edge that i often accidently touched the edges of the screen, it doesn't happen with the "edges" of this screen anymore.
##i have a google pixel xl and i'm going to switch for the samsung galaxy s8, not the s8+, because even with my big hands i have to stretch my hand to be able to reach for the fingerprint sensor of the s8+.
##the screen of the s8 is even bigger than the google pixel xl by 2% already and the total size of the phone is smaller than the pixel xl.
##in terms of the software update, it's slower to be released than for the google pixel xl, but it's faster than for the carrier phones, like at&t, verizon, t-mobile, etc.
##you can't go wrong with this phone, in general terms, comparing all the features, pros and cons, it's the best in the market.
##pros: -design -wireless charging -latest processor -bluetooth 5.0 -mobile hdr premium technology -no problems (at least for me) in touching the edges of the screen accidently.
##-water/dust resistance ip68 -good battery optimization -usb type-c -headphones 3.5mm input -akg earbuds included -great quality camera -beautiful display (image) -usb type-c to usb adapter included -usb type-c to usb adapter included -pay safely virtually at any store with samsung pay (something that apple pay and android pay can't do) -comes already with android 7.0 nougat -expandable storage via microsd card.
##cons: -comes with 64gb of internal memory with no other options with more storage other than through the microsd card -no unlimited storage on the cloud for pictures and videos (like google pixel and pixel xl) -fingerprint in one of the worst places possible.
##-sound not that great with only one speaker (not stereo)
[t]Great phone and a fair price
##i didn't buy from amazon but i did get one from metro-pcs.
##i'm blown away by this phone and i've only had it about 2 days.
##first off let me say how great the battery life is.
##i'll provide a real life example of use.
##i took it off the charger at about 3pm on 4/27/17.
##i texted, watched videos, surfed the web for a few hours, played a high graphics game & live streamed on youtube for an hour and the phone is only at 50%.
##thats a lot of use for about 12 hours.
##i loved the s7 edge and this is everything and extra.
##the screen is outstanding and cant say enough good things about this phone.
##its exactly what you want out of a phone plus more.
##sure its a lot of money, but you're paying a good price for something simply amazing.
##if you have the cash, just buy it.
##it's well worth it.
[t]A Big Advancement Over Samsung's Previous Phones
##note: i am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.
##a quick prologue: i had been laying low since buying two samsung galaxy s6 edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, i loved it that much).
##i knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), i knew the s7 edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward.
##so i bought my s6 edges with the thought in mind that i would have it for at least 2-3 years.
##my analysis was that samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. i gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies.
##fast forward to this year, and i have not been wrong - samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020).
##with the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of hdr technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.
##i loved my s6 edges, but i got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a rose gold iphone 6s last year, while keeping the white s6 edge.
##i loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light.
##if you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my s6 edge.
##it is so good i have replaced my travel dslr with it (i still use my canon 5d mark iii for my serious projects), and all my instagram photos are also from my s6 edge (you can find the link to my ig on my amazon profile).
##sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the s8 is even better.
##do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the s7 edge.
##it is not the same.
##it is a new camera system developed by sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains hdr and selective focus elements/photo modes.
##it excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the s7 edge's camera.
##it might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps sony camera in its new xperia x phones, but for everyday use, i feel this is the best phone camera so far.
##it has electronic image stabilization (eis), even up to 4k video recording, which is a first for phone cameras.
##the front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13mp camera of the lg g6.
##this is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but i know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that.
##the resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi.
##the technology is samsung's very own oled, called samoled.
##it is the same basic technology that makes the best tv screens in lg's oled tvs.
##samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever.
##you can read more technical specs from display mate:  displaymate.
##com/galaxy_s8_shootout_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)  how samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well.
##instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on a 18:5.9 ratio, which just sounds really weird.
##this is pretty much a 3:1 ratio, which is quite unheard of.
##even lg's unique g6 phone has a different 18:9 (or 2:1) ratio.
##so this is samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year).
##i really don't know why they chose this ratio, as even cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio.
##so there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all s8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels.
##this phone is actually more narrow than the s6/s6 edge.
##the s8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the s6 edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. but as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier.
##so although the s8 has a total footprint that is larger than the s6 edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand.
##for further comparisons, the iphone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iphone 7 plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the lg g6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g).

[t]Worst phone I have ever had
##i bought this phone on cyber monday to replace my motorola moto x 1st gen. i was hoping to get an iphone 8, but there were no deals on it, so i got this samsung galaxy s8.
##at first i was very excited to have it, but now i hate it.
##the fingerprint scanner is oddly placed, it is not easy for me to use, it is slower than an iphone x or iphone 8, and i just discovered that it uses the same camera as last years s7, and it is very fragile, i have had the phone for less than 3 months and there is already a crack in it.
##worst phone i have ever had and i wish i had bought an iphone 8 or x.
[t]Man I love Amazon but I have no choice than drop my ...

##(what a joke!!!)
##i write this review to protect you the customer which suppousedly is amazon north star (the most customer centric company on earth, remember?).
##other sellers on amazon, state on the item description (very upfront) that no us warranty is provided.
##this seller buries that information on the bottom of the publication!
##after contacting amazon customer rep several times and having them promising that they will issue a refund and submit an az claim to seller, they decided  not to honour their statement  and leave me with a broken phone for a misleading publication for a seller which obviously is not customer centric.
##man i love amazon but i have no choice than drop my prime membership.
##i want to be very clear that if you buy this phone and for some reason stops working you are out of luck.

[t]Don't expect Samsung to support this product
##samsung phone support is terrible.
##i own many samsung products.
##two televisions, a sound bar for each one, a computer monitor and three s8 phones for my family and i.  i have never had to call for support for any samsung products until recently when i reset one of the phones tripping the factory reset protection (frp-google lockout).
##i was then locked out of my phone and my nightmare began.
##i opened a trouble ticket with samsung support and followed their instructions for verifying ownership of the phone.
##they failed to follow-up with me and when i called back to check the ticket status, i was told the ticket was created incorrectly so they had to close and re-open a new ticket.
##they asked me to wait another 24 to 48 hours for resolution.
##the time elapsed and again they failed to follow-up with me.
##i called back and was told they needed another 24 hours.
##once again no follow-up.
##i called back and was told the ticket was closed because the receipt i had emailed them did not contain enough information for verification of ownership.
##i now have a third ticket opened, have sent them 3 emails containing information they requested and still cannot use my phone.
##i can only say i have enjoyed the samsung products i have purchased until this recent experience, but in the future i will consider the quality of support when buying my electronics.

##some friends can hear me, some cannot.
##and i mean they really can't hear a thing and get annoyed with me since i refuse to put the phone to my ear for safety reasons.
##super annoying when watching to youtube because the edge feature is too sensitive and all phone covers are designed to not cover up the edges.
##the youtube program changes if you fingers get within 1/16th of an inch of the edge of the screen.
##how do you hold the phone and not get anywhere near the edge?
##you don't actually have to touch the screen to change youtube programs.
##then there is no back button to get back to youtube i was just watching.
##other phones have a back button.
##screen is way too sensitive.
##even setting phone face down on electrical wires will change youtube program.
##putting phone in pocket while youtube is playing changes the youtube channel 100% of the time no matter how careful i am to not touch the screen.
##i do not watch youtube in full screen... usually searching for next video while one is playing.
##another super totally annoying feature is screenshots.
##you have to hold down the volume down button and the power button at the same time..90% of the time the volume just changes and no screenshot.... or screenshot with volume bar showing.

##the best phone i've ever purchased, amazing display, great camera, the only problem, is that i got the uk version, meaning, my adapter was different than what i use in the u.s., so i had to buy a fast charging adapter separately

##amazing phone
[t]THIS PHONE HAS NOT WARRANTY!
##the phone is amazing, but when it stopped working, it become impossible to get the customer support to fix it.
##the phone stopped charging after charging in 6 months and still does not respond to any new cable types.
##it is still on the warranty, but despite the fact that the product is registered samsung is still not responding and the seller is silent!
##sounds like a money waste for this price!!

##good deal
[t]One Star
##i received a fake, replica, non functional what-so-ever phone on jan 23, 2018. will be aggressively pursuing a refund.
[t]Very happy with the unit so far
##brand new phone, factory direct.
##software update came in less than an hour.
##it took two hours to load.
##very happy with the unit so far.
##got a spigen case, it feels better in the hand with a case on it.
##no carrier bloatware.
[t]TouchWiz is STILL SLOW
##headphones broke in a week.
##edge screen makes it impossible to hold and actually use, and most of all touchwiz though better and prettier than before still destroys the android experience with some time of use, making this very capable piece of hardware slow and clunky.
##the camera is good but shows photos ridiculously saturated.
##they obviously cared very little about having realistic color and instead try to go the bright, flashy route.
##not to mention any time i open the camera it lags because the phone can't even handle to process it's own camera.
##let alone record in 4k with it without the video having skips in it... i'm afraid people who like samsung phones haven't used anything better.
[t]It's a display phone - Check for verified reviews. Don't buy
##i was excited about a great deal on the s8.
##when i had received it everything looked good until i put in my sim card.
##i realized that when i took the sim card out it said that i had full bars of signal but when i put it back in it had no signal.
##i realized that it was a display phone from a store.
##then i lost money on the refund.
##make sure to check for "verified reviews"

##poor design.
##back is made of glass and is super slick i dropped before i had a case and cracked the glass, why have a glass back?
##that's dumb.
##the edge idea is cool but it has draw backs, screen protectors don't work good on them and case don't protect edge, so screen is more susceptible to damage.
##i had an s4 that lasted 3 years, but this s8 already needs replacing.
##so if your hard on phones get something else.

##excellent, i love with my new phone
[t]Beware of the limitations.
##if you plan to activate the phone with us carriers you will not get 4g data service.
##you will get hspa which is a little slower and good enough for most people.
##everything else will work.
##for example if the phone's imei number is not in at&t's database , then lte will not be supported.
##at&t does not provide a solution such as adding the phone's imei into their database when you contact them.
##this is how they and others discourage people buying phones from others.
##the sellers won't tell you this.
##at&t and verizon will not tell you this.
##your congressman will not do anything about it.
##oh well  there are other things more important in life.
[t]But was happy with the purchase
##was sceptical buying an international unlock.
##but was happy with the purchase.
[t]Another great Samsung Product!!
##love it!
##i have had all the samsung phones, with the exception of the note 7 (we all know why haha), and this one is my favorite so far.
##looking fowards to see what they bring to the table with the s9.
##i bought mine while being stationed in italy and having the international version makes things sooo much easier when traveling for work and needing different sim cards while in other countries.
##after about a month of use, i bought a docking fast charger also to make my life a little easier, since i kept pulling messing up my charging cables.
##here is the link for the fast charger, if anyone was curious, along with a case that fits extremely well.

##beware this could be a model that has the wrong firmware on it.
##it may not be possible to swap the firmware.
##it'll have the languages on it, etc.
##such that it is usable however, there could be things on your calendar that can not be removed, other aspects of the phone could change depending on the firmware installed.
##the alerts(test, amber, etc.)
##cannot be turned off with this foreign firmware.
##even if they say they're turned off, they will come through whenever they're sent, think about it.this is my issue with the phone for the software, i come from having a note 3 and a note 5, i am basically spoiled by the notes, the screen is better in that i don't have to worry about a beveled screen.
##that aspect of the screen does alter how what you're looking at appears there.
##i do a lot of reading, its annoying to have the screen like that.

##phone arrived boxed neatly, works well on the flow hspa+ & gsm networks, however does not work on flow's lte band 13 network in the caribbean.
##appears that some variants of the sm-g950f are compatible with lte band 13, this one however, does not.

##the selfie camera hardly ever worked, it would never stay in focus for more than a second so it would take forever to get a good looking picture, and it was not as water resistant as they say it is, i want to the beach and the phone was under water " less than 2 feet" for less than a minute and but the time it was out if the water it wouldn't turn on
