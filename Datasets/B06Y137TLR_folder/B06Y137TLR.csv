None of these icons are listed on the Samsung support website nor in the user manual for the phone. I contacted Customer Care and they had no clue what they were either and could not help at all. I finally got it working but wanted to change the way the clock was displayed on the lock screen. Again, no info in the manual or on the website. Customer Care said that it was not possible to change the display even though the pictures of the themes show it. Again, after hours of frustration, I figured it out. Same thing with the Emergency Alert settings. Still haven't figured out how to turn those off and, again, Samsung Customer Care is clueless as well. This would be a great phone if you could delete all the Samsung apps and just run the basic Android apps. Never should have bought a Samsung.

This is what I sent them, ""Hello, I recently bought an international version of your unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8. It said to contact you if I was in need of a charger that fits American plugs. How do I go about getting one of these and how much are they from you?"" This is what they replied with, ""we will ship you USA plug for it free of charge."" All I did was click on seller information and put it in an ""ask a question."" As for the phone it is very smart and connects well with other devices, such as a smart TV especially a Samsung Smart TV. Bixby is the ""siri"" for this device and works great.

The fingerprint sensor is on the back - not as comfy as the front facing old iPhone sensor but it's usable. it's not a one-hand phone it's a bit bigger than that and I have big hands. I love the pairing with the S3 Gear and the Samsung Health App. It has face unlock and fingerprint reader and passcode. I miss the dedicated silent button from the iPhone this needs to be UNLOCKED before I can silence it but there is a completely unnecessary Bixby button. There should be a silence button instead of that. The camera the iPhone camera is markedly better I'm sorry to say that but looking at the photos I took and I take now I can see it. Overall I think this is the best Android phone you can get I might also get an iPhone but not the X that is hideous with the notch the protruding camera and the glass back - maybe a 7 or 8. Hope they'll come out with something better and I also hope Samsung LISTENS to users. We don't want the Bixby.

I got mine through Fed Ex this morning so I will update my post in a few weeks but so far, I could not be happier. I got my phone from a different vendor out of Australia but shipped directly to me from Hong Kong, but I suspect it will be the same phone no matter when you buy it.<br /><br />My service provider is Metro PCS, which I am very happy to find out that I can keep and I took my phone to my local Metro PCS store and they got my phone working in less than 15 minutes. They explained the functions of the SIM slot #1 and #2 and how to insert a micro card. I had Metro add the International Calling plan to my phone for texting and calls from the U.S. I will use the SIM slot #2 for when I travel to France. Having a backup will help out.<br /><br />The style and glass front of the phone is very nice and it does not leave fingerprints. My old phone is the Samsung Galaxy Avant and I find that having my new phone is not difficult to re-learn. Some of the basic functions are the same.<br /><br />After getting home, I entered my passcode for my home wi-fi and the phone took it immediately and updated itself promptly. I also got the bluetooth function connected to my Fiat Sport 500c in less than five minutes. The batter powers up in no time to full and this morning, out of the box, my phone was at about 50% power. It took about 30 minutes to get it to 100%. So far, the battery tends to drain slowly.<br /><br />I read from another post of this phone that it did not have wi-fi. Not sure what happened, but this phone certainly does have it.<br /><br />The cord has a different end that plugs into the phone, so my old USB cords won't work however, the S8 box includes some attachments. One attachment is a small add-on that will fit on the small end of the USB cord so you can keep your old cords. The box also adds a connector so you can transfer files from one phone to another, or a computer to your phone and finally a 100-240 charging plug is included in the box, but it is not for European sockets nor American sockets. The two male connectors are slightly slanted so I suspect this is for Asia.<br /><br />I am not going to clone my Galaxy Avant software to my new phone because I want to begin fresh again. I will pick and choose each app but my Avant still works at home with my wi-fi and Magic Jack phone.<br /><br />There is only one slight disappointment; I expected the phone to be more of a gold tone color. The back of the phone is not really gold, but a slight gold tone with an odd color that seems to change color depending on the light available. Also, the front glass is gold tone once you pull up the apps, SMS, dialer, etc.<br /><br />I find this phone to be very advanced and a very good buy for the money I paid. It's basically a mini-computer and I use it for everything from driving, texting, phone, pictures, banking, buying, etc.<br /><br />This phone is definitely an incredible upgrade from my Avant and I am very pleased. I will update my post in a few weeks to a month.",5,positive

B06Y137TLR,"on March 23, 2018",amzn1.account.AEMIPMHSFS34PXOROAA6YI326D7Q,"Fantastic, but with one drawback.","For clarification I have the U.S model of this phone with the snapdragon processor.<br /><br />I'm going to keep this review short and sweet because frankly I could talk about this phone all day. I've had this phone for a few months now and am now ready to review it, I'll break down this review into build quality, screen quality, weight, audio quality/call quality, processor speed, camera quality, battery life and ease of navigating the software.<br /><br />- Build quality is outstanding, the phone looks and feels as good as it gets.The phone is a little slippery though so I do recommend a case for it, more on that later.<br /><br />-Screen quality- This is by far the best display I have ever seen on a phone, samsungs amoled display technology is at the top of its game. Colors pop,contrast is incredible and the blacks are truly black and because of the curved screen the content you view on it whether its photos or videos has an almost 3d effect to it. Samsung also offers display adjustments in phone options if you want more neutral colors instead of the saturated colors amoled is known for, either way this display is top notch!<br /><br />Weight- Suprisingly light weight for how sturdy it feels. The S8 feels good in pocket and won't have you wishing you had a lighter phone anytime soon.<br /><br />Audio quality/<br />Call quality - Audio with this phone is above average but not the best, music, movies, games all sound good whether you're using head phones or the phone speaker, the phone speaker does distort at high volumes though, but you'll most likely be using headphones anyway. The included earbuds that come with the phone were very good (at least before they shorted out) so heads up on that, also I'd recommend a eq app like power amp if you want to fine tune your sound. Call quality on the other had is hands down phenomenal, I've made a lot of calls with this phone and have constantly been blown away with how crisp and clear the calls are.<br /><br />Processor Speed- Calling this phone fast is an understatement, I've tried my best at times to get this phone to slow down and just can't do it. Everything is snappy and instantaneous whether youre opening an app or loading a web page. This phone doesn't break a sweat!<br /><br />Camera quality - The camera on this phone is fantastic, the photos are amazing, with one downside low light photos fo have more noise than I'd like in them. I'll attach some example's to this review so you can see for yourself. This phone won't replace a high end dedicated camera, but you could do a lot worse.<br /><br />Battery Life - I have to give credit to both Samsung and android for this one. The battery life on this phone is outstanding, i can get two and a half days out of this phone easy. I'm pretty easy going on my phone though, I wouldn't call myself a power user by any means, but I didn't put this phone through its paces a couple times and and came out impressed, even with heavy usage and screen brightness turned all the way up this phone made it through a day and a half of nothing but videos, web surfing, and music playing with battery to spare. If you need even more run time, you can put the phone into varying degrees of battery saving modes that can squeeze out even more run time ( the emergency mode can give you months of battery time, granted you can't do much else besides make calls but it could be a life saver).<br /><br />Ease of navigating software - Short answer is its cake. The long answer is its intuitive and ridiculously easy to move around in menus and find what you are looking for. Samsung has really out done themselves here and it shows. Honestly I can't think of a single negative about the software, it's done so well.<br /><br />Now, for the drawback I mentioned earlier in the review. Finding a case with a screen protector for this phone that actually works, and doesn't impede the use of the screen is kinda impossible because of the curved screen, even otter box doesn't have on that works. You can always buy one of the wallet type cases to cover the screen, it'll help avoiding damage. Of course if a screen protector isnt a big deal for you then you're golden. The phone does have the latest and greatest gorilla glass 5 on it so scratches really aren't an issue I've noticed zero on my phone. The wallet case I have on my phone has held up well and protected my phone from a couple of drops I'll be reviewing that shortly. I don't count this against the phone because this isn't really big deal to me but it might be to you, at the end of the day this phone is incredible and if your in the market for a phone the S8 should be at the top of your list.",5,positive

It is without a doubt the best camera in a smart phone i've ever seen to date. The pics it can take are amazing and just as good as my $5000 camera i use for professional photography. It blows away apple in my opinion, Yes apple has some decent phones but ISO is not quite a computer if you ask me they can't be plugged into any PC without having to download itunes which comes with malware that you don't know your installing on your PC and can damage some pc's.<br />It also installs some other apps you don't know your getting that can cause serious issues with system settings in the PC if its not an apple.<br />Any android can be plugged into any PC without a problem with no software to clog up your PC. The processor is killer,4 gig of ram! And I was sold on the camera immediately.  Being in a dark room or outside at night the pictures are crystal clear and can be adjusted with the pro setting it can take some time to figure out if you are not a photographer but still very user friendly.The battery is OK but if you don't have a app killer constantly killing background apps it will drain your battery pretty quick. But this can be controlled, Power battery is my most recommended app killer that keeps apps closed and keeps tabs on the battery. It really does not need any cleaner apps since one is built in. I can't wait for the s9 to come out they are both going to be around the same price? the s8 and s9 at least for a while. I give the s8 5 stars!!!",5,positive

A 1 foot drop can shatter the screen or back glass. They might have fixed the glass in later models but if they didn't it is FIXABLE! Go to ebay and search for galaxy s8  screen replacement. Make sure it is NOT just a glass screen protector. It should come with a set of tools to replace your screen and/ or back. Basically you'll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone. The kit comes with new glue. Search youtube for how to videos. You will have to unscrew the back and disconnect several connectors. If you do not think you can do it cell phone repair shops can fix this phone for you. The kit is only $25 on ebay,  I don't know what shops charge.

Below is my list of pro and con.<br />Pro:<br />Decent Camera, good with low light environment.<br />Great Battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone I had in the past.<br />Support wireless charging, water-proof.<br />Less overheating.  It gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold.<br />Con:<br />Unusual Screen ratio.  Most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market.  This also make it more difficult to type, I often press wrong key by accident due to spacing.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good phone.

Always a step ahead of Apple and I liked the flexibility of Android. Bought S8 and I had to say it is the worst Galaxy I've owned.<br /><br />The main issue is screen that cracks SO easily. I didn't even drop the phone, I sat down and it was in my pocket, and the little bump of the phone caused the screen to crack. In a few more days I got a few more cracks. There is absolutely no value in the ""infinity"" screen, it's beautiful but worthless. In my 8 years of owning multiple Galaxies I only cracked the screen once, and I dropped it many times. S8 has a design flaw.<br /><br />Then there's Samsung bloatware that annoys the hell out of you. Bixby is useless but you can't disable it. It wakes up when a button is pressed accidentally in your pocket and it starts making noises, sometimes launching apps... What a piece of garbage!<br /><br />Samsung keyboard and speech recognition is much worse than Google's but they enable it by default.<br /><br />At least Samsung has accepted my return and out of loyalty I bought S7 which I am much happier with.",2,negative

My biggest concern is that repairing a cracked screen costs 200-300 USD and that I know I would have to repair it again just a few weeks later.<br /><br />Of course, I have tried to be very careful, but due to the full glass body of the phone, it is extremely slippery and will slip out your pocket and fall of any surface very quickly and easily.<br /><br />I have been a faithful Samsung customer for many years, but unfortunately I will probably not have a choice but need to look for a high end smartphone of LG, Sony or HTC now.<br /><br />PS: The stunning Edge-Glass-Infinity-Screen design is the cause of this deal braking problem.

There's a reason people buy android phones, to stay away from stupid niche's like that. The side bar app thing they show as a selling point is also pointless, it's another stupid feature they add to make this phone ""look"" like they've added something new from the older phones. But in reality it's just the same as having certain apps in a folder on your wallpaper.

I definitely wanted to experience something small but with a larger screen. A lot of people complain about the  location of the fingerprint scanner, which does  take some getting used to. But keep in mind that this is actually a natural position to place the scanner. Hold whatever phone you have in your hand and really think about where you place your fingers and how you are holding your device. See what I mean? I found this new location much more convenient than using the scanner with my thumb on the front of my phone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there was something I couldn't get past with this particular model. The edges are more pronounced and cause a plastic-y looking glare when in the sunlight. I almost switched back to my iPhone 7 plus, but after using the S8 for a few days, it felt, and looked, old and clunky! If you are used to bigger phones, upgrade to the plus. If you've never had a super large phone, the s8 would be perfect for you!<br /><br />Also, please note that the orchid gray doesn't stand out as much indoors, as it appears much darker.

B06Y137TLR,"on February 20, 2018",amzn1.account.AE72IWFHJTIXISBMMMQE4LTYFZQA,Worst Customer Service Ever,"So, let me start off by saying that I really did love my expereince overall with this phone. It's fast, pretty, and top of it's class. That was until one day, my phone began to crash randomly throughout the day. I thought maybe it just needed a reset, so I did just that. The problem persisted yet, so I have Samsung a call, and this is where my experience with Samsung was shot down, strangled, and ground into dust. It began with my first couple customer calls, I followed all of their data reset regulations and yet the issues were still going on. So, they stated I needed to send the phone in and have it looked at and fixed before they could do anything else (which was totally fine with me the first time). I asked them about a loaner phone while mine is repaired, and they stated that my carrier provides that and they do not. So, I called my carrier and they stated that Samsung provides that and they do not. Very frustrated with that I called back and was told Samsung could not do anything, so I was stuck with a hand me down Iphone, but it is just a temporary phone, Right?...Wrong! but Ill get to that later. After waiting the 1.5 weeks to have my phone repaired and sent back I smiled as I opened the box and restored my phone, finally I could just get back to using it again. Skip ahead 12 hours when the issue is still happening! So I message there online care center using there online chat and there service representative informs me that if it is not working again, they will most likely get me an exchange device. They tell me to call the Executive care staff, but in order to get to them you must speak with their first level of customer service EVERY SINGLE TIME! No matter what you tell them or who's name you drop they always need the whole story and waste 30 minutes of your day before informing you that they need to escalate you to their executive customer care department (No lie, this happened to me every time I called until I stated I refuse to talk to them). Now, after that I spoke with a executive care assistant (ECA). They informed me that the person who told me that I could get an exchange was wrong and that there needs to be multiple repairs on a device before it can be exchanged and that it needs to be sent in AGAIN! Frustrated with the broken guarantee I asked to speak with a supervisor, the supervisor stated the same stuff that the ECA said but did state she could get me expedited shipping (Woohoo...). So again I packed my device and drove to a UPS and dropped it off, dreadfully sliding my sim card back into that Iphone. This time it only took 1.2 weeks (wow, what a difference) to get my phone back, and upon looking at the service receipt I noticed there was nothing marked as to what they performed, shrugging I thought maybe they just forgot. I restored my phone once more and yet again, it crashes not even 1 hour later. So a little peeved I call again (and go through the 30 minutes of the first representative :D) and after speaking with the ECA she states that it looks like they did a software update (rightttttttt) and then sent it back. I inform her that it is still having these issues, she then informed me that it still does not qualify for an exchange because there was not anything repaired the last time I sent it. Trying to control myself I ask her if there are any other options aside from sending it in again for weeks. She states sadly no and that she has no idea if I will ever be able to actually get an exchange or refund because it has to meet ""repair criteria"", again I angrily pack my phone up and ship it, waiting another 2 weeks to get my phone again because of the holidays. So I open the package when I get it back and don't even reset the piece of crap Iphone because I knew that it was going to happen once more. I guess right!  The phone crashed again and again. So i call once more and this is were I just refuse to speak to the 1st level of help, sensing my frustration and probably looking back at my last couple notes they pass me along. Finally I am offered the exchange I wanted from November 2017. Mind you it is now the end of January! I give them all the information, give them all my receipts (which I luckily still had) and they stated they will email me with a shipping label and directions. So, I wait yet another week for them to contact me, puzzled I call them and they stated they have nothing in their system about an exchange. Taking a nice cleansing breath I try to not explode on this poor representative who can surely tell that I am not happy. At this point I demand a refund, the representative tries to persuade me otherwise but at this point I would never want to deal with this ever again if I have an issue down the road. So, she states that she will start the refund process, around 1.5 hours later she states it has been submitted and I will receive info within 2-3 business days. So, giving them a break I wait the full 3 days, and guess what? Still no emails or calls. I call again and I informed that they having nothing in their system about a refund, just information about an exchange. I laugh into the phone and say they must be joking, the ECA stated she is very sorry but they have no record and we must restart the process once more. I swallow my anger, trying to be a sensible and caring man and begin this 2 hour process once more, and this ECA gives me her direct line and email after the process is finished and states she will email me with updates to ensure that I get it done in a timely manner. So, I send my phone in once again! and this is in February at this point! Waiting a couple of days and not hearing anything I just email her, asking for an update, no answer! I try again a day later, and no answer once again. I give her direct line a call 2 times in 1 day and leave a kind message just asking for an update. Two days later I have yet to hear anything. So I call there ECA department once more and I am told that it can take 7-14 business days or 7-21 regular days for a refund to be issued. I tell them it has been nearly 2 weeks since my 1st attempt and over 1 week since I sent the device in and they just tell me that it is pending and I need to wait. So, I wait another 4 days, still no updates from anyone, my package tracking has been at there warehouse for over a week now because I can see it on UPS's website. I call very upset and speak to yet another ECA, he stated that he is sorry, and was confused as to why they have had it a week and why it was still pending. He informs me that the process has yet to even start. At this point I am frustrated yet again and demand to speak to a supervisor, he tries to tell me they can't do anything special, but at this point I need to let someone know my frustrations with this whole process. So, he transfers me and upon someone picking up they just hang up on me. So, I call again and I am told by the 1st level that the ECA told them that they have done all they can for me at this moment and that I need to wait (uh no, I am speaking to someone about this because at this point I deserve to be listened to), I wait on hold for over an hour to speak to the 1st level supervisor who literally picks up and tells me that she just needed to see what was wrong before she could transfer me. So, she transfers me and I wait another 45 minutes before speaking to the ECA supervisor. He tells e he is sorry and that he would personally email the refunds/exchange department to have my refund ""expedited"" I ask him to let me speak to them because it has been over 2.5 weeks since my initial call and I am paying for a phone that I haven't been able to use for months now. He informs me that they do not take calls and they can only be contacted by ECA through emails. Frustrated I hold my tongue and ask him for his direct line and email, he gives it to me and tells me to call him for any questions or updates and that the refund'exchange dept should get back to him that day and he would let me know their response. Nothing comes that day, or the next, or that week! So, I try to call that supervisor, no answer and I leave a message, no response 2 days later. I call yet again and jump through the hurdles and hoops, I am told that they are having issues with their computer system and that their accounting dept was closed the day before and that my refund is still pending (WHAT?!?!) I laugh yet again (because at this point I am just so shocked at how horrible this service is) and I am informed that I need to call again in 24 hours to see where it is at. At this point I am on day 19 of the 21 days they guaranteed (although from all the false guarantees I have gotten from them, I doubt it will be on time). I inform the ECA of this and she asks me to just be patient and ""they are doing their best"". I still have yet to get my money back, I am still paying for this phone which I literally have not been able to use since November. I have wasted HOURS of time speaking to this company and their service is so poor I can safely say that Samsung will not be a brand in my life or my families life. I hope that someone from this company gets to see this and fixes the issues. I hope that someone considering buying this phone reads this and takes into account what will happen if an issue arises. A multi- billion dollar company should not be making a customer jump though hoop after hoop to resolve a mistake THE COMPANY made. I just want to state that I normally am very understanding of mistakes and I have a great deal of patience for human error. But when a mistake happens over and over and when a promise is broken nearly every time there comes a point when your experience needs to be shared and the issue needs to be resolved. I also know that this is just a phone and that the world has way worse issues, but I am a working Father who doesn't have the extra time or money to buy a new phone after the device given to me was defective. I hope this is helpful to people and thanks for listening to my rant!",1,negative

From Sony Xperia XZ to htc 10, until I found the Note 7, too bad it was recalled, went on the hunt again, or was it then that I got the XZ?, anyway ended up with the Google Pixel, which though very good, still felt like an unfinished product compared to the Note.<br />Back to this S8 here. I'm gonna just mention the basics, coz I see so many in depth reviews here, so if ur confused about any phone compared to this one, feel free to comment on my review, I'll try to answer from experience!<br />- The edge to edge screen is amazing, put it next to any phone out there and it stands out. I really can't stop looking at it because it's so sharp! Any picture, movie, YouTube video looks just better on this screen.<br />- The camera is just great! While the pixel was advertised as the best camera on a phone, I still think this S8 is a little better.<br />- Games and apps run fluently on this phone, no lags whatsoever, this phone will run anything u throw at, no sweat.<br />- The size is just perfect, and the weight too!  It feels as big as my Google pixel but with twice the screen size (not exact measures if ur one of those! ) iWas gonna get the S8 plus, but felt it was oddly too tall and the width wasn't just adequate to the length, but the S8 is just the perfect size, easier with one hand too.<br />-The battery is nothing special, I can say I'm an above average user and it lasts almost all day. Obviously when u play more or watch more Netflix, on that gorgeous screen, u'll need to charge it twice, but on most days I didn't need to.<br />You'll not regret getting that phone, definitely the best on the market right now.

I have zero complaints about these two phones.<br /><br />The screen on my OP2 cracked, so I decided to splurge and got myself this beauty. In retrospect, I should have just repaired my OP2's screen. The S8 was an absolute (and expensive) disappointment.<br /><br />It gives you gimmicky features such as the iris-scan, the heart-rate monitor, edge-lighting, which are honestly a bit useless, in my opinion. The curved screen, while a novelty, is incredibly pointless, and in fact creates glare at the edges which makes it very hard to see notifications when the phone is mounted in your car.<br /><br />A lot of people are annoyed about the finger-print scanner's location. It's not ideal, but I've tolerated it and it seems to work okay for me.<br /><br />Android purists will not be happy with the fact that Samsung tries to force their ""Google Now"" clone called ""Bixby"" onto the user. It is a complete reinvention of the wheel and does not work nearly as well as ""Google Now"" does. They have even dedicated a button to this abomination and have made sure that it cannot be re-mapped to do anything else. a truly annoying restriction on the user who paid a lot of money to have a customizable phone - Otherwise, I would have gotten an Iphone, had I wanted to be locked into a certain way of doing things.<br /><br />Some very common widgets (Such as Google Keep) simply don't display correctly on this phone. They display perfectly fine on other Android phones, but not on this, possibly due to the aspect ratio.<br /><br />The all-white theme that is forced upon the user is not only an eye-sore, it makes notifications indistinguishable from one another.<br /><br />Ultimately, the phone is nothing more than a status symbol and yes, it's pretty.

First drop, concrete, shattered - and one small crack = dead phone. Because the darn thing is needlessly ENTIRELY GLASS, and virtually NO edges, any cracks splinter across the whole phone. Cracks in the middle (mine was ONLY on the right ""infinity"" edge area) cripple all touch sensors above the middle, so I could only dial numbers, not use the keypad even trying to get the phone fixed.<br />The insurance company REFUSES to replace these; they found every excuse to prevent me getting a replacement for 10 DAYS! I demanded Sprint make it right, but, as nice as Sprint support is, the insurance company they use is a bag of D's. RUDE! They even accused me in the end of phone insurance fraud. WTF!? So I left Sprint for T-Mobile on principal and paid the remaining $700 balance for the STILL DEAD PHONE.<br /><br />Second phone (first with TMobile) survived about a week and a half. It was about the second drop, just about 2 feet off the ground IN A PROTECTIVE CASE! Looking at it right now. I knew all phone carriers have the same insurance, so I've decided to just get a Samsung J7; basically a Note 4 without the stylus. Since I'm looking at my Note 4, which as slight scratches on the screen, and some metal ripped off the side from drops, it still works perfectly, I'm glad to have a cheaper phone I don't mind so much  breaking, and will eventually file a claim with TMobile, once I can stomach the concept of dealing with that insurance company again.<br /><br />I love Samsung, but I HATE this phone!

My Biggest beef is with BIXBY!, I'm very disappointed that Bixby is only half baked. Shame on Samsung for not having it ready by release and also for not letting you re-map the Bixby button to something else.. The Battery is O.K. but not great and for the money  I think the phone should have 6Gs of RAM. Screen resolution automatically being set to the lower resolution tells me that Samsung might still be a little gun shy because of what happened to the Note 7.<br />All in all I really like this phone but if you haven't got it yet you might want to wait to see what Bixby is really like, that is if that sort of thing is important to you.<br />**6/2/17 **<br />I had to come back to this and drop a star fro this review because as of today Samsung still is not able to get Bixby up and running in the U.S. I mean what good is a voice assistant device with no voice!!!

If i could give the the device a 4.5 I would but that is not how amazon works.<br /><br />I have one single complaint. the dedicated Bixby button is probably the most annoying thing I have ever used. at first you could remap the button (i changed mine to the home key) but that change would be reverted within a day and you would then have to go remap the key again. just recently Samsung REMOVED the ability to do that because people were using google assistant instead of their own assistant Bixby. since the ability has been removed i ended up having to find an app that made it so i could disable all of the 6 packages that is Bixby. doing this removed all functionality of the dedicated button on the side of the device. It is really stupid to have a pointless button on the side of my phone, but at least i don't have to worry about accidentally pushing it and having an application that i do not want/ use show up on my screen.",4,positive

On the downside, it won't receive timely software updates, and fingerprint scanner location is a minor setback.<br /><br />It's hard to choose your next phone because there are so many good options today, and potentially good phones coming later this year (2017). By now you've probably seen a million reviews on the S8, but it doesn't make the decision easier. Here's my suggestion, in two quick steps. Make sure none of the cons below are deal-breakers for you. Then, look over the list of unique advantages, and see if they get you excited enough to pay the hefty $750. If you're still here after that, then welcome to the club! Be sure to check out my final tips for maximizing your S8 experience.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Edge screen is beautiful, but annoying in two situations.  It creates visual distortions a little (less than S7 Edge though).  It is also difficult to hold the phone up in the air, face down (e.g. before sleep), as the phone is prone to accidentally registering side touches.  A case remedies the latter problem, but I dislike putting a case on such a beautiful phone (see pro tip #1).<br />2. Samsung is not very good with software updates.  If you take great pleasure from trying new Android in a timely manner, this isn't for you -- the only two options are iPhones and Pixels.  That said, keep in mind that new software updates typically slow down the phone.<br />3. Fingerprint scanner location has been mentioned a gazillion times.  Yes, I wish it was on the front.  No, it really isn't that bad on an S8 (S8+ is a different story).  You know, we have this thing called ""muscle memory""..  It took me two days to adjust to the new location, and now I have no problems.  If you really hate it, try facial recognition or iris scanner, they're very good (see pro tip #8)<br />4. The phone has glass back thats prone to cracking, so watch out if youre clumsy.  But see pro tip #1<br />5. S8 doesnt have monster battery life, and it needs to be charged once a day.  If you need to go past a day, look elsewhere.<br />6. Some are disappointed about a lack of dual-camera.  Personally, the rear camera is wide enough that I am rarely in a situation where I feel the need for a wide-angle lens (like in LG).  An optical zoom would have been nice (like in Iphone 7+), but not really an issue for me (see pro tip #6)<br /><br />UNIQUE ADVANTAGES<br />1. Futuristic aesthetics of a bezelless all-screen phone.  This doesnt really improve the functionality of the phone, but theres just something satisfying about this futuristic experience.<br />2. The screen is just so damn beautiful, no contest here.  Always-on display is useful.<br />3. As of today, its the only phone that checks ALL of my needs: Excellent rear camera, excellent front camera (reviewers too often ignore this), water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro SD card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the S8, Bluetooth 5.0!<br />4. Bluetooth 5.0 is amazing.  S8 is a first phone to come with this, and its awesome.  I frequently use the ability to connect to two different speakers at once, for a surround-sound like experience in my room.  You can also listen to the same music with your friend in a library, by connecting to two different headphones.<br />5. S8 is also the first phone to come with Gigabit LTE, which is nice for future-proofing the phone, but it doesn't quite help us yet.<br /><br />PRO TIPS<br />1. Consider getting a tempered-glass screen protector (theyre better on S8 than on S7 Edge) and a Slickwraps/dbrand skin for the back.  The skins make your phone look unique, improves grip, and it also helps cover up cracks if youve dropped your phone.  Slickwraps frequently has discount promotions on their website, so watch out for that.  Dont use a case, enjoy the beautiful phone!<br />2. Bixby is useless, and if youre like me, most Smart assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns.  You can remap the Bixby button (as of April 2017): See https://www.xda-developers.com/3-applications-bypass-bixby-restriction/<br />3. General Android tip: Go to Settings, Developer Options, set Window/Transition/Animator animation scales to x0.5 to speed things up (Google this if you dont know what I mean)<br />4. General AMOLED tip: Take advantage of black wallpapers to save battery life<br />5. Set screen resolution up to QHD.  In my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use.  Going HD will significantly improve battery life if you are a heavy gamer, or use CPU intensive apps a lot.<br />6. If you really miss dual-camera set-ups in other phones, consider getting a separate smartphone camera lens kit that sells for ~$20.  Theyre less convenient than a built-in dual lens, but on the upside theyre much more versatile and fun.<br />7. If you are still not convinced whether to buy S8, then wait.  Most phones (except iPhones and Pixels) drop prices relatively quickly, and you may be able to snatch one up cheap refurbished in auction sites.<br />8. Contrary to some reviews, the facial recognition and the iris scanner are reliable and fast.  In my experience, how you register your face/iris determines how effective it will be.  If you wear glasses, register with glasses on.  Also, register under medium lighting conditions and not in extreme conditions.  You want the phone to be able to recognize you under different environments.<br /><br />It's a really nice phone, highly recommended.",5,positive

B06Y137TLR,"on April 9, 2017",amzn1.account.AE5RJROH3X3GX2LW6YPXOQKFFMUQ,A Big Advancement Over Samsung's Previous Phones,"Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.<br /><br />A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.<br /><br />I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile).<br /><br />Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6.<br /><br />This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate:<br /><br />displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)<br /><br />How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on a 18:5.9 ratio, which just sounds really weird. This is pretty much a 3:1 ratio, which is quite unheard of. Even LG's unique G6 phone has a different 18:9 (or 2:1) ratio. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). I really don't know why they chose this ratio, as even cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels.<br /><br />This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8).<br /><br />The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AKG-Bluetooth-Headphone-Black-Y50BTBLK/dp/B01BX72RUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-EVO-256GB-UHS-I-microSDXC-U3-Memory-Card-with-Adapter-MB-MC256DA-AM/dp/B01JNGCWHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM)</a>.<br /><br />My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.<br /><br />In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8.

On the downside, it won't receive timely software updates, and fingerprint scanner location is a minor setback.<br /><br />It's hard to choose your next phone because there are so many good options today, and potentially good phones coming later this year (2017). By now you've probably seen a million reviews on the S8, but it doesn't make the decision easier. Here's my suggestion, in two quick steps. Make sure none of the cons below are deal-breakers for you. Then, look over the list of unique advantages, and see if they get you excited enough to pay the hefty $750. If you're still here after that, then welcome to the club! Be sure to check out my final tips for maximizing your S8 experience.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Edge screen is beautiful, but annoying in two situations.  It creates visual distortions a little (less than S7 Edge though).  It is also difficult to hold the phone up in the air, face down (e.g. before sleep), as the phone is prone to accidentally registering side touches.  A case remedies the latter problem, but I dislike putting a case on such a beautiful phone (see pro tip #1).<br />2. Samsung is not very good with software updates.  If you take great pleasure from trying new Android in a timely manner, this isn't for you -- the only two options are iPhones and Pixels.  That said, keep in mind that new software updates typically slow down the phone.<br />3. Fingerprint scanner location has been mentioned a gazillion times.  Yes, I wish it was on the front.  No, it really isn't that bad on an S8 (S8+ is a different story).  You know, we have this thing called ""muscle memory""..  It took me two days to adjust to the new location, and now I have no problems.  If you really hate it, try facial recognition or iris scanner, they're very good (see pro tip #8)<br />4. The phone has glass back thats prone to cracking, so watch out if youre clumsy.  But see pro tip #1<br />5. S8 doesnt have monster battery life, and it needs to be charged once a day.  If you need to go past a day, look elsewhere.<br />6. Some are disappointed about a lack of dual-camera.  Personally, the rear camera is wide enough that I am rarely in a situation where I feel the need for a wide-angle lens (like in LG).  An optical zoom would have been nice (like in Iphone 7+), but not really an issue for me (see pro tip #6)<br /><br />UNIQUE ADVANTAGES<br />1. Futuristic aesthetics of a bezelless all-screen phone.  This doesnt really improve the functionality of the phone, but theres just something satisfying about this futuristic experience.<br />2. The screen is just so damn beautiful, no contest here.  Always-on display is useful.<br />3. As of today, its the only phone that checks ALL of my needs: Excellent rear camera, excellent front camera (reviewers too often ignore this), water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro SD card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the S8, Bluetooth 5.0!<br />4. Bluetooth 5.0 is amazing.  S8 is a first phone to come with this, and its awesome.  I frequently use the ability to connect to two different speakers at once, for a surround-sound like experience in my room.  You can also listen to the same music with your friend in a library, by connecting to two different headphones.<br />5. S8 is also the first phone to come with Gigabit LTE, which is nice for future-proofing the phone, but it doesn't quite help us yet.<br /><br />PRO TIPS<br />1. Consider getting a tempered-glass screen protector (theyre better on S8 than on S7 Edge) and a Slickwraps/dbrand skin for the back.  The skins make your phone look unique, improves grip, and it also helps cover up cracks if youve dropped your phone.  Slickwraps frequently has discount promotions on their website, so watch out for that.  Dont use a case, enjoy the beautiful phone!<br />2. Bixby is useless, and if youre like me, most Smart assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns.  You can remap the Bixby button (as of April 2017): See https://www.xda-developers.com/3-applications-bypass-bixby-restriction/<br />3. General Android tip: Go to Settings, Developer Options, set Window/Transition/Animator animation scales to x0.5 to speed things up (Google this if you dont know what I mean)<br />4. General AMOLED tip: Take advantage of black wallpapers to save battery life<br />5. Set screen resolution up to QHD.  In my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use.  Going HD will significantly improve battery life if you are a heavy gamer, or use CPU intensive apps a lot.<br />6. If you really miss dual-camera set-ups in other phones, consider getting a separate smartphone camera lens kit that sells for ~$20.  Theyre less convenient than a built-in dual lens, but on the upside theyre much more versatile and fun.<br />7. If you are still not convinced whether to buy S8, then wait.  Most phones (except iPhones and Pixels) drop prices relatively quickly, and you may be able to snatch one up cheap refurbished in auction sites.<br />8. Contrary to some reviews, the facial recognition and the iris scanner are reliable and fast.  In my experience, how you register your face/iris determines how effective it will be.  If you wear glasses, register with glasses on.  Also, register under medium lighting conditions and not in extreme conditions.  You want the phone to be able to recognize you under different environments.<br /><br />It's a really nice phone, highly recommended.",5,positive

I did have to get the $59 pack from walmart but only used the nano sim to replace the existing sim that was too large, so I still have the service plan for next month.

Although it did transfer apps but not passwords, for example my wink hub app went over keeping all switches and routines but I had no clue what many of the passwords were. As I was dealing with a dead old phone i could just reset them via that before wiping it. The mains charger has European prongs but I have many USB wall chargers so no big deal.

B06Y137TLR,"on April 9, 2017",amzn1.account.AE5RJROH3X3GX2LW6YPXOQKFFMUQ,A Big Advancement Over Samsung's Previous Phones,"Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.<br /><br />A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.<br /><br />I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile).<br /><br />Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera.

Two televisions, a sound bar for each one, a computer monitor and three S8 phones for my family and I.  I have never had to call for support for any Samsung products until recently when I reset one of the phones tripping the Factory Reset Protection (FRP-Google lockout).  I was then locked out of my phone and my nightmare began.<br /><br />I opened a trouble ticket with Samsung support and followed their instructions for verifying ownership of the phone.  They failed to follow-up with me and when I called back to check the ticket status, I was told the ticket was created incorrectly so they had to close and re-open a new ticket.  They asked me to wait another 24 to 48 hours for resolution.  The time elapsed and again they failed to follow-up with me.  I called back and was told they needed another 24 hours.  Once again no follow-up.  I called back and was told the ticket was closed because the receipt I had emailed them did not contain enough information for verification of ownership.  I now have a third ticket opened, have sent them 3 emails containing information they requested and still cannot use my phone.<br /><br />I can only say I have enjoyed the Samsung products I have purchased until this recent experience, but in the future I will consider the quality of support when buying my electronics.",1,negative

Speaker phone is a decent volume.  Love the size of the screen.  Can't use speakerphone with a few people... my phone does not sound good when calling other Samsung S8 phones or some other brands too.  Some friends can hear me, some cannot.  And I mean they REALLY can't hear a thing and get annoyed with me since I refuse to put the phone to my ear for safety reasons.  Super annoying when watching to youtube because the EDGE feature is too sensitive and all phone covers are designed to NOT cover up the edges.  The youtube program changes if you fingers get within 1/16th of an inch of the edge of the screen.  How do you hold the phone and not get anywhere near the edge?  You don't actually have to touch the screen to change youtube programs.  Then there is no BACK button to get back to youtube I was just watching.  Other phones have a BACK button. Screen is way too sensitive.  Even setting phone face down on electrical wires will change youtube program.  Putting phone in pocket while youtube is playing changes the youtube channel 100% of the time no matter how careful I am to not touch the screen.  I do not watch youtube in full screen... usually searching for next video while one is playing.  Another super totally annoying feature is screenshots.  You have to hold down the volume down button and the power button at the same time..90% of the time the volume just changes and no screenshot.... or screenshot with volume bar showing.  Extremely hard to get a clean screenshot.",3,negative

Edge screen makes it impossible to hold and actually use, and most of all touchwiz though better and prettier than before still destroys the android experience with some time of use, making this very capable piece of hardware slow and clunky. The camera is good but shows photos ridiculously saturated. They obviously cared very little about having realistic color and instead try to go the bright, flashy route. Not to mention any time I open the camera it lags because the phone can't even handle to process it's own camera. Let alone record in 4K with it without the video having skips in it...

You will get HSPA which is a little slower and good enough for most people. Everything else will work. For example if the phone's IMEI number is not in AT&T's database , then LTE will not be supported. AT&T does not provide a solution such as adding the phone's IMEI into their database when you contact them. This is how they and others discourage people buying phones from others.
