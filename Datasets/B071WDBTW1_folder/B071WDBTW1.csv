I don't need to worry about losing or breaking it, I can always get another one and still be way ahead of the game. I think its an ideal phone to order fro yourself or for your children as a cheap alternative.<br /><br />I chose this model because it has a removable battery. Batteries are my pet peeve with cellphones these days, it seems that many only last a limited amount of time and then you need to get a new phone (or be very technical in order to disassemble and replace a non-replaceable battery).

I've gone from the old nokia tank of the early 2000's, to Nokia E63 (terrible symbian...I think that piece of junk os was a lead anchor that helped sink em down) to iPhone 3Gs to iphone 4 which I used up til just last week when I got this Moto G5.....It feels like a HUGE leap going from iPhone 4 to Moto G5..  I don't remember being this thrilled about using a new phone.<br />PROS:<br />-LTE connection in Manila, Philippines....Got impressive 25+mbps download speeds via Globe.<br />-Impressive Google Assistant I've used for the following::<br />-driving directions.  Provided you turn your data and location on beforehand, you can get directions completely voicecommand...If youre already travelling, you can also, with voice command, ask for specific restaurants along the route.  Ever needed to do that?<br />-identifying songs playing on the radio....I'm still exploring.  If I had to choose between fancy camera or Google Assistant, I'd choose Googe Assistant in a heartbeat.  I compared it yesterday with iPhone 8 and 10's Siri which was completely demolished.<br />-SMS messaging hands free.  Allows you to send, read out loud, reply, read out loud your reply to check for mistakes (and it does happen unfortunately when it's a long text) , and make corrections to your text reply  completely HANDS-FREE.  What does this mean?  No need to pull over to text your friend you're meeting up when you're running late.<br /><br />Other PROS you may find useful:<br />-The  Moto G5 camera is quite decent and does the job if you need to capture images for documentation.  Why get a fancy camera for posting to social media which will be degraded anyway?<br />-It is so intuitive.<br />-It has the tools I needed to make tasks easier.<br />-The price is great.<br />-Perfectly-sized screen and body.  Ive seen a few reviews complainig about the ""big bezel"" but I don't even notice it and actually think it is great in keeping you from accidentally touching the sides of the screen unintentionally.<br />-Nice classy body and design.  I disagree with what some reviewers calling it cheap plasticy-looking which it doesnt so don't listen to people--just see it for yourself because it's obviously subjective.<br />-Speaker is nice and clear when listening to music.  Unless you expect a mobile phone to shatter glass with mega bass, it sounds really pleasant for easy listening.  Again, just try it and see. You may miss out on this great product because some reviewers didn't like the speakers.<br />-User-replaceceable battery.  all my past phones' most common problems were related to battery problems so i wanted it easy to replace, especially because the higher model moto g5 plus was quite difficult to diy and expensive to take to motorola. i wud have bought the g5 plus if it werent for the battery.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-turbocharging does not work.  it just charges at a CONSTANT 1+minute/% charge ....0 to 100% in more than 2 hours.  This is annoying because I purchased a couple of expensive extra chargers for the car and travel with quick charge feature only to find out the phone doesnt have the advertised 50% charge in 15 minutes I've seen around.  This charging is consistent in all 3 chargers including the original turbocharger that came with the phone.<br />-no compass<br />-slippery body/back cover.<br />-barely enough battery life that last barely a day of moderate use.<br /><br />I wanted to keep it slim by not bothering to purchase a protective cover for it given that it did quite well in drop tests I've seen online, but the slippery body always feels like it's about to slip off my hands and leap into the ground.  I am now looking for a cover for it.  The battery is just barely enough to last a day so that deducts points to give it a 4 instead of 5 star.  I will give an update but this far, I'm so impressed by Google assistant.  Siri was such a useless piece of work in iPhone.  Attached are screenshots of the results when I gave the commands quoted text.  Google Assistant demolished Siri....",1,negative

I don't like that it isn't a WiFi hotspot, but... It's a quick little thing for cheap so, I'm happy, and no need to switch chargers from my old phone too.

B071WDBTW1,"on December 24, 2017",amzn1.account.AHAKLMH7X7NNYQSLIJ63XE7B2QCA,Buy it for battery life,"Great battery life. I think I just listed the only good thing about this phone. Also responsive enough and will keep you just fine all day with the battery.<br />Now, here come the negatives:<br />- First and foremost and most obvious: The screen. It's just awful. Washed out colors. Seriously now, I had much older phones with better screen quality.  Others confirmed it with color-range software, that the display is missing colors, like it's not 16mill color like the most basic 32bit RGB, but less. Whether or not, this was a design feature for some design reason or Lenovo had keep the phone cheap and went with the cheapest and most obsolete LCD screen they can find in China, I don't know. But if you have ever owned any phone in the recent 3-4 years with an LCD, then this is gonna be so obvious, you may even consider to return it and I wouldn't hold it against you.  (I won't even mention if anyone owned OLED and AMOLED screens like the Samsung or LG and compare , because after one of these, this phone looks like a bad joke) .<br />I can also see the popularity of this phone and why. This might be the only phone listed on amazon, which has the most bands and compatible with nearly every service provider in the US and throughout the world. (that's a good thing)<br />Another negative :<br />-This is by no means is a speed demon phone. It will get you through with Facebook Twitter and the usual social networks out there, but don't think you gonna be pushing the bleeding edge in speed with 3D gaming. As I said, this phone will work with everyday tasks just fine. Just don't think you're buying an alternative to the top tier smartphones out today.<br />- Camera. Just..meh. If you had cellphones in the past 5 years, this is that midrange phone camera, which isn't particularly bad, but neither great. Again, don't compare it to top tier phones, costing double or triple the price.  Let's just say, it makes pictures and they are not better than average, but not too bad. Actually I had a hard time telling by looking at it on the phone screen, because of the washed out /faded/lifeless screen display it has. You really have to upload them somewhere and check it on a computer display or on another phone.<br />- Speakers.  While I like the idea of the speaker placed on top by the ear speaker, it still sounds tiny. They could have tried a bit harder, and put another in the bottom to make this a stereo sounding phone, like the HTC or the iphone. But again, I'm sure the costs were considered.<br />- No notification light. I got kinda used to it on a Samsung and on HTC (my previous phones) and apparently there is a notification light placed on the phone (according to youtube videos), but it's deactivated for some reason and cannot be re-activated anyhow. It turns on on low battery , I could be wrong on this. Anyway, you won't see it flashing, so if you desire one, look elsewhere.<br />-Front fingerprint sensor. While it's quick to read the fingerprint, this phone begs for a home button. I keep trying to push it, just because I'm used to it. Others may consider it as a plus, I don't.<br />So here you go. My review after using it on/off for nearly a year. It's dependable, battery life is fantastic, compatible with al the  cell networks, but don't expect to be blown away.",3,negative

The 13 megapixel camera and the screen are just about in the same league as big boys like Iphone or Samsung, way better than my LG.  The nugget software on the other hand is way different than android marshmallow.  Issue number 1 was ring tones you can't add a newly downloaded ringtone unless you download a new file manager app as a work around.  Issue number 2 if you get a or a missed call or text on all previous androids you will get a number on the appropriate icon.  In this nugget software you better pay close attention to your alert screen, because there will be no numbers on the phone or text icons to let additionally remind you to check your missed calls or texts.  This is kind of quirky and annoying, but I am getting used to that deficiency.  If anyone knows how to make a work around this issue it would be greatly appreciated and  I will change my 4 stars to 5, but until then it will stay at 4 stars.

Only one of two SIM card will gain the 4G LTE, the other one will fall back to 2G, which is obsoleted by AT&T in US, so one of the two SIM cards has to be able to connect to T-Mobile towers, like T-mobile or its MVNOs or any international SIM card roaming in T-mobile's coverage. And if you turn on data on a T-Mobile SIM, then the AT&T sim will have no service at all, because of falling back to 2G. So, the combination of 2 SIM cards can be either 2 T-Mobile SIM cards or 1 AT&T SIM card specifically for data plus 1 T-Mobile SIM card for talk and text.<br /><br />Metallic back cover is not that high quality as I thought.

That being said, onlyl Honor 5X has all the above features, but Honor 5X has been out there for two years and the new US version Honor doesn't have those features in one anymore.

The rest functions still work, but I am out of luck for repair since it's not US version and Motoorola is not covering US repair under the warantee contract.  I saw there are many complain on the ghost touch issue and I tried all fixes even factory reset.

Clear audio on calls. Connectivity radios work fine (dual SIM's, A-GPS, Bluetooth hands free and audio, wifi). Cameras are fine for what they are. Nice looking phone. There is very little noticeable lag.  I upgraded from a Moto G2. Nougat has some nice features. I haven't used the fingerprint reader - but it's nice to have. The FP reader doubles as a bottom buttons function (Back, Home, Recent apps) thereby allowing more screen real estate at the bottom. The 'Moto ' app allowed me to pretty easily to swap devices taking my apps with me so that saved me a good bit  of time. Very decent battery life.<br /><br />Here are my major issues which made me deduct 2 stars.<br />1. The speaker phone volume is too low :@.<br />2. The power from the audio jack is a fair bit lower than the G2. When I plug into my externally powered book shelf speakers at home, at max volume on the phone, it is only maybe half of what it would have been with the G2. :@<br />3. The back cover does not have the textured backing like the Moto G and G2 - which annoys me, because now it slips out my hand easily :@. And I may now be forced to get a thin rubber case just for that reason!<br />4.  The micro SD card slot is tricky! It is not intuitive as to how far it needs to go in and at the first attempt I think I shoved mine in too far, and it looks like I damaged the pins inside the slot so now it doesn't read my SD card. So buyers be VERY CAREFUL when inserting your SD card. It does not go in all the way. At least the onboard 32GB (24 GB free) makes up for me not having an SD card in.<br />5.

It is not yet being offered by Amazon for the Moto G5, but it is for the Moto G4 Play so easy to replace your G5 battery when necessary.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this phone (it replaces a Moto g4 ""standard version"").  Among the reasons:<br /><br />1.  Dual sim.  I am an expat in the Dominican Republic and in the past I have been traveling with 2 phones when going to the US.  Now I just have to move a couple sliders as the plane nears either country to begin making calls as soon as plane lands.<br /><br />2.  I like having a removable battery even though I might not keep the phone until the battery dies.  But you never know.  At least now I am assured that if the battery dies prematurely I can replace it<br /><br />3.  The print reader is a plus for me.  With the G4, to put the phone to sleep I had to short press the power button then to wake it up I again short pressed the power button and put in my 4 digit password. With this phone, once it is turned on I don't need to press the power button for anything until I am ready to turn it off.  To put it to sleep I just press the print reader, then to wake it I just press the print reader again.  The phone wakes up immediately and is ready for business.<br /><br />This phone is a bit smaller than the G4.  I liked the size of the G4, but this phone feels good in my and the size difference doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would.<br /><br />I have read reviews about annoying background noises when you are on a call, but I don't experience that.  I get very good reception and the people I talk with say they can hear me clearly,  without noise or distortion,  and the volume is good.<br /><br />I am happy with the camera, too.  It is as good or better than the one on my G4.  The saturation is a little better, too.  When you set up the camera you are asked if you  want rich color or natural.  I chose natural, but still the color is a bit richer than on my G4.  Not over saturated, however.  The pictures look good and I don't have to do as much editing on the camera as I did with the G4.<br /><br />I think the video is a bit better, too.  A little more color and a bit sharper.  I sent a clip to someone I chat with and she commented very positively about the new phone based on the video.<br /><br />The sim cards are smaller on this phone than the G4, nano size, and where you put them is different.  There is a good illustration of where they go in a little user guide that comes with the phone but the guide is in Spanish.  Apparently this international version  was designated for Spanish a speaking country.  However,there are short videos on YouTube showing what goes where and what to do it that will make it all clear for you if you don't read Spanish.  I do but still found the videos helpful.<br /><br />The screen is brighter and the colors are richer.  I find it more appealing to the eye.<br /><br />The phone comes with only 32 GB of storage, however, I put in a 128 GB SD card and added it to internal storage.  Now I am loaded for bear and will likely do more with movies and videos than I did with the G4. I can't move it between phones since it is in internal storage, but when I get a new phone I can format it and use it in that phone.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I should spend the money for the G5 since the G4 was only a year old.  But I really wanted a dual sim phone and now I have that as well as other things I didn't have on the G4.  I am glad I did the upgrade.",5,positive

B071WDBTW1,"on May 6, 2017",amzn1.account.AHBJMHIXBKV5WIZUK2MTCDJJDKBA,"Good phone, but a few drawbacks for me","This is the Dual SIM international GSM version. Phone works fine. Clear audio on calls. Connectivity radios work fine (dual SIM's, A-GPS, Bluetooth hands free and audio, wifi). Cameras are fine for what they are. Nice looking phone. There is very little noticeable lag.  I upgraded from a Moto G2. Nougat has some nice features. I haven't used the fingerprint reader - but it's nice to have. The FP reader doubles as a bottom buttons function (Back, Home, Recent apps) thereby allowing more screen real estate at the bottom. The 'Moto ' app allowed me to pretty easily to swap devices taking my apps with me so that saved me a good bit  of time. Very decent battery life.<br /><br />Here are my major issues which made me deduct 2 stars.<br />1. The speaker phone volume is too low :@.<br />2. The power from the audio jack is a fair bit lower than the G2. When I plug into my externally powered book shelf speakers at home, at max volume on the phone, it is only maybe half of what it would have been with the G2. :@<br />3. The back cover does not have the textured backing like the Moto G and G2 - which annoys me, because now it slips out my hand easily :@. And I may now be forced to get a thin rubber case just for that reason!<br />4.  The micro SD card slot is tricky! It is not intuitive as to how far it needs to go in and at the first attempt I think I shoved mine in too far, and it looks like I damaged the pins inside the slot so now it doesn't read my SD card. So buyers be VERY CAREFUL when inserting your SD card. It does not go in all the way. At least the onboard 32GB (24 GB free) makes up for me not having an SD card in.<br />5. Phone gets extremely hot (upper back side) when running GPS / navigation. Although - the back cover has a number of copper pins sticking out on the underside of it so there may be antennas located in the back cover (??) for better reception (??).",3,negative

B071WDBTW1,"on March 19, 2018",amzn1.account.AH3FS42WQ6CMDHUMLE2Y4TK3G5IQ,An affordable Dual-Sim phone with some puzzling missing features,"The Moto G5 was bought  to replace my aging Nuu X4, once I realized that early promises of upgrades to Android OS in the latter were not going to materialize.<br /><br />The G5 is faster than my old phone, and has better battery life, and also more storage space, so it's hard not to like it. It also uses Android 7, so the more granular permissions control is very nice. On the other hand, there are a number of gaps that are hard to understand.<br /><br />One of the first things I ran into was that it doesn't have a magnetometer. Now, that may not mean anything to you, but it means that the phone doesn't have the ability to act as a compass. As a result, navigation programs are limited, because they don't know what direction I'm facing. There are also a number of sweet programs that don't work as well if you can't determine a heading with the phone's hardware.<br /><br />Because I wanted the Dual Sim capability, my phone is an International model, and while everything else is in English, the system upgrade notification is in Spanish. That's a little awkward for me, though not impossible to deal with.<br /><br />Most of the other limitations relate to things that Motorola does or doesn't include with their software. It's taken a while to get used to, but nothing serious.<br /><br />Will I recommend the Moto G5, or buy another one? Hard to say. The price was very attractive (a big part of the reason I bought it) but some of the missing features have been frustrating. I may need to try something from another vendor before I decide if Moto will get me back. The plethora of cheap phones makes it hard to sort out the trash from the gems, and budget-sensitive buyers like me often get squeezed by not having all of the information available.",4,positive
