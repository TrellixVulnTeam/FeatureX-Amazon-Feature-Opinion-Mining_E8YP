##this is a terrific little phone - does everything that the big boys do but is so much cheaper!
##i don't need to worry about losing or breaking it, i can always get another one and still be way ahead of the game.
##i think its an ideal phone to order fro yourself or for your children as a cheap alternative.
##i chose this model because it has a removable battery.
##batteries are my pet peeve with cellphones these days, it seems that many only last a limited amount of time and then you need to get a new phone (or be very technical in order to disassemble and replace a non-replaceable battery).
##with this phone you can easily remove it and replace it with a battery ordered from china - its the same as the g4 battery and they sell for well under $20 from ali express.
[t]Great Android Phone at bargain price.

##battery life is also great.
[t]Five Stars
##ok.
[t]Nice but FALSE advertising with quick charge
##i've had this phone for almost a week now and love it so much!
##i've gone from the old nokia tank of the early 2000's, to nokia e63 (terrible symbian...i think that piece of junk os was a lead anchor that helped sink em down) to iphone 3gs to iphone 4 which i used up til just last week when i got this moto g5.....it feels like a huge leap going from iphone 4 to moto g5..  i don't remember being this thrilled about using a new phone.
##pros: -lte connection in manila, philippines....got impressive 25+mbps download speeds via globe.
##-impressive google assistant i've used for the following:: -driving directions.
##provided you turn your data and location on beforehand, you can get directions completely voicecommand...if youre already travelling, you can also, with voice command, ask for specific restaurants along the route.
##ever needed to do that?
##-identifying songs playing on the radio....i'm still exploring.
##if i had to choose between fancy camera or google assistant, i'd choose googe assistant in a heartbeat.
##i compared it yesterday with iphone 8 and 10's siri which was completely demolished.
##-sms messaging hands free.
##allows you to send, read out loud, reply, read out loud your reply to check for mistakes (and it does happen unfortunately when it's a long text) , and make corrections to your text reply  completely hands-free.
##what does this mean?
##no need to pull over to text your friend you're meeting up when you're running late.
##other pros you may find useful: -the  moto g5 camera is quite decent and does the job if you need to capture images for documentation.
##why get a fancy camera for posting to social media which will be degraded anyway?
##-it is so intuitive.
##-it has the tools i needed to make tasks easier.
##-the price is great.
##-perfectly-sized screen and body.
##ive seen a few reviews complainig about the "big bezel" but i don't even notice it and actually think it is great in keeping you from accidentally touching the sides of the screen unintentionally.
##-nice classy body and design.
##i disagree with what some reviewers calling it cheap plasticy-looking which it doesnt so don't listen to people--just see it for yourself because it's obviously subjective.
##-speaker is nice and clear when listening to music.
##unless you expect a mobile phone to shatter glass with mega bass, it sounds really pleasant for easy listening.
##again, just try it and see.
##you may miss out on this great product because some reviewers didn't like the speakers.
##-user-replaceceable battery.
##all my past phones' most common problems were related to battery problems so i wanted it easy to replace, especially because the higher model moto g5 plus was quite difficult to diy and expensive to take to motorola.
##i wud have bought the g5 plus if it werent for the battery.
##cons: -turbocharging does not work.
##it just charges at a constant 1+minute/% charge ....0 to 100% in more than 2 hours.
##this is annoying because i purchased a couple of expensive extra chargers for the car and travel with quick charge feature only to find out the phone doesnt have the advertised 50% charge in 15 minutes i've seen around.
##this charging is consistent in all 3 chargers including the original turbocharger that came with the phone.
##-no compass -slippery body/back cover.
##-barely enough battery life that last barely a day of moderate use.
##i wanted to keep it slim by not bothering to purchase a protective cover for it given that it did quite well in drop tests i've seen online, but the slippery body always feels like it's about to slip off my hands and leap into the ground.
##i am now looking for a cover for it.
##the battery is just barely enough to last a day so that deducts points to give it a 4 instead of 5 star.
##i will give an update but this far, i'm so impressed by google assistant.
##siri was such a useless piece of work in iphone.
##attached are screenshots of the results when i gave the commands quoted text.
##google assistant demolished siri....
[t]Great price for it's features
##so far so good... although if you can spare it, get the plus for a little extra.
##it is way difficult to find cases for this phone.
##the one touch navigation button is a nice addition, though on certain settings it is a little annoying to use.
##i don't like that it isn't a wifi hotspot, but... it's a quick little thing for cheap so, i'm happy, and no need to switch chargers from my old phone too.
##if you're coming down from a large phablet type phone, be prepared for it to slip out of your hands the first few days you're using it.
##camera excels over my last one (nexus 6), and the phone gestures are useful
[t]Great deal for the price
##i owned previous version of this phone.
##great deal for the price.
##i was not expecting a totl phone.
##what i received would not boot.
##that's a pretty big difference.
##the phone was stuck on a boot loop.
##i tried all recommended solutions for this model and version of android, spent many hours on solutions.
##nothing.
##maybe there are some of these that aren't junk, but i certainly wouldn't gamble it.

##calls and text messages are no problem.

##working forums to fix, we'll see.
[t]Buy it for battery life
##great battery life.
##i think i just listed the only good thing about this phone.
##also responsive enough and will keep you just fine all day with the battery.
##now, here come the negatives: - first and foremost and most obvious: the screen.
##it's just awful.
##washed out colors.
##seriously now, i had much older phones with better screen quality.
##others confirmed it with color-range software, that the display is missing colors, like it's not 16mill color like the most basic 32bit rgb, but less.
##whether or not, this was a design feature for some design reason or lenovo had keep the phone cheap and went with the cheapest and most obsolete lcd screen they can find in china, i don't know.
##but if you have ever owned any phone in the recent 3-4 years with an lcd, then this is gonna be so obvious, you may even consider to return it and i wouldn't hold it against you.
##(i won't even mention if anyone owned oled and amoled screens like the samsung or lg and compare , because after one of these, this phone looks like a bad joke) .
##i can also see the popularity of this phone and why.
##this might be the only phone listed on amazon, which has the most bands and compatible with nearly every service provider in the us and throughout the world.
##(that's a good thing) another negative : -this is by no means is a speed demon phone.
##it will get you through with facebook twitter and the usual social networks out there, but don't think you gonna be pushing the bleeding edge in speed with 3d gaming.
##as i said, this phone will work with everyday tasks just fine.
##just don't think you're buying an alternative to the top tier smartphones out today.
##- camera.
##just..meh.
##if you had cellphones in the past 5 years, this is that midrange phone camera, which isn't particularly bad, but neither great.
##again, don't compare it to top tier phones, costing double or triple the price.
##let's just say, it makes pictures and they are not better than average, but not too bad.
##actually i had a hard time telling by looking at it on the phone screen, because of the washed out /faded/lifeless screen display it has.
##you really have to upload them somewhere and check it on a computer display or on another phone.
##- speakers.
##while i like the idea of the speaker placed on top by the ear speaker, it still sounds tiny.
##they could have tried a bit harder, and put another in the bottom to make this a stereo sounding phone, like the htc or the iphone.
##but again, i'm sure the costs were considered.
##- no notification light.
##i got kinda used to it on a samsung and on htc (my previous phones) and apparently there is a notification light placed on the phone (according to youtube videos), but it's deactivated for some reason and cannot be re-activated anyhow.
##it turns on on low battery , i could be wrong on this.
##anyway, you won't see it flashing, so if you desire one, look elsewhere.
##-front fingerprint sensor.
##while it's quick to read the fingerprint, this phone begs for a home button.
##i keep trying to push it, just because i'm used to it.
##others may consider it as a plus, i don't.
##so here you go.
##my review after using it on/off for nearly a year.
##it's dependable, battery life is fantastic, compatible with al the  cell networks, but don't expect to be blown away.

##for the money this phone is great.
##the biggest disadvantage to iphone (which i ditched), is the lack of easy visual announcements on the icons of missed phone calls, email, whatsapp and massages.
##annoying also are the constant, and i mean constant,  system updating popups.
##the camera in good light is quite useful.
##so far holds charge really well.
##the sound is clear which i appreciate especially.
##figuring out how to transfer file via usb was the gymnastics which should be eliminated; it is  not intuitive, rather  in some way it is a hidden function.

[t]One Star
##bought this phone exactly one month ago and now it crashed.
##does not turn on now.
[t]Powerful and fast Phone.
##this is an awesome, and fast phone.
##i like it very much, and it would be hard to beat at this price point.
##it is a step up from last years moto g4, and was a good investment in my opinion.
##i hope maybe there will be an update to the oreo version of android sometime in the future.
[t]No Tethering & portable hotspot
##i did quite a bit of research before buying this phone (obviously not enough).
##i was looking for a powerful phone (cpu, ram etc) with the latest os and dual sim.
##but i wanted a small size (5").
##quite a tall order for the us market.
##no one makes such a phone.
##the g5 was perfect but is not made for the us (the g5 plus is).
##so i bought this international version.
##the phone would have been perfect, a 5 star but the "tethering & portable hotspot" capability is greyed out.
##maybe this is a problem with my phone or motorola decided that this basic feature that has been in phone for years needs to be removed.
##very disappointing.
##i have sent an email to the retailer of this phone hoping they may have a solution.
[t]Great phone, common wifi authentication problem
##this phone has a common issue where the wifi will not authenticate, i have been unable to connect to wifi since getting the phone.
##i am still seeking a solution and if i have to return the phone i'd like to get a new moto g5 and test my luck, it is otherwise a great phone.
[t]Best choice for dual SIM card.
##i don't have it up and running yet - waiting to receive new sim cards from my service providers.
##note that the instructions included are in spanish, and i had difficulty finding the correct product manual on line.
##you need to go to the uk website of motorola in order to obtain the manual.
##the phone looks nice, has the two sim card slots that i needed, and hopefully all will work well when i get my new sim cards.
##as there is not a lot of choice available in dual sim card phones, this one seems to be the best choice - a good phone at a reasonable price.
[t]Purchased April 2017 - Useless November 2017
##i hate this phone.
##it was great at first for 1-2 months then went downhill.
##it's buggy, slow, unresponsive, randomly states no coverage/cell coverage.
##and has horrible call quality.
##it has bad battery life that never lasts.
##i bought this in april 2017 it was okay for 1.5 months.
##then started having random reboot issues non-stop for months where it's on and using and then reboots.
##the phone now has the power and volume buttons all broken as of november 13th, 2017. so this lasted about half a year.
##now i have to look for a new phone due to motorola and their horrible products.
##i don't recommend motorola ever, it's horrible quality, and products

[t]Excellent, full-featured smart phone
##purchased via consumer cellular.
##i had a moto g4 that was stolen; it worked well, but was not as crispy/fast..  this g5 is somewhat smaller, much thinner, fits in my pocket better.
##if you use a purse, maybe you don't care, but the latest cell phones with 5.5" screens are not pocket friendly.
##this guy is fast, has a great display, takes really good pictures.
##i have no issues with the microphone, the screen, or any other aspect of the phone.
##it's considerably more "intuitive" than my old iphone.
##battery life is excellent, at least several days depending how much you use it..  i have no complaints at all.
[t]What I was looking for!
##so far so good.

##i bought this phone a few months ago.
##i went for the g5 as the g5 plus and others are too big.
##im happy with it overall but the notifications bug (you need to move your phone to see if you missed a call or text while it was sleeping) is annoying.
##according to the setup it should work: battery friendly notifications fade in and out while the screen is off to show you whats going on   ill add another star when that is fixed.
##love the uncluttered pure android.
##battery life exceeded expectations.
##zero to full charge in ~2 hours is impressive.
##the high-grade aluminum looks great but is too slippery to hold with one hand, so i had to buy a case for it.
##whats the point of a great looking phone if i have to cover it with a cheap case in order to use it!
##this seems to be the trend with all phone companies, not just motorola.
##i upgraded from a moto g1 to the g5 and i miss the grippy black housing and the notifications led.

[t]VERY GOOD PHONE, THOUGH SLIPPERY
##the phone is really good.
##it works fast, lte flies, it has enough internal memory (32 gb), at least for me, and the size is neither too big nor too small.
##very importantly, it can carry two sim nano cards, which is very convenient if you wish to have two cell lines in one phone.
##so far the only downside for me is the material that it is made of.

##for the money i think it is a very good phone.
##the octacore processor is way faster than any previous phone i owned.
##the 13 megapixel camera and the screen are just about in the same league as big boys like iphone or samsung, way better than my lg.
##the nugget software on the other hand is way different than android marshmallow.
##issue number 1 was ring tones you can't add a newly downloaded ringtone unless you download a new file manager app as a work around.
##issue number 2 if you get a or a missed call or text on all previous androids you will get a number on the appropriate icon.
##in this nugget software you better pay close attention to your alert screen, because there will be no numbers on the phone or text icons to let additionally remind you to check your missed calls or texts.
##this is kind of quirky and annoying, but i am getting used to that deficiency.
##if anyone knows how to make a work around this issue it would be greatly appreciated and  i will change my 4 stars to 5, but until then it will stay at 4 stars.

[t]Awesome screen and fingerprint reader
##fhd screen is clear and sharp.
##fingerprint reader function is awesome!
##don't have to press it down, just pick up the phone from table and place thumb on it and it will unlock the phone.
##the unlocking experience is so close to the fantastic iphone 7!
##i also have a samsung galaxy s7 edge and the unlock process of it is so painful, not to mention it is so much more expensive than the moto g5.
##dual sim function is decent.
##only one of two sim card will gain the 4g lte, the other one will fall back to 2g, which is obsoleted by at&t in us, so one of the two sim cards has to be able to connect to t-mobile towers, like t-mobile or its mvnos or any international sim card roaming in t-mobile's coverage.
##and if you turn on data on a t-mobile sim, then the at&t sim will have no service at all, because of falling back to 2g.
##so, the combination of 2 sim cards can be either 2 t-mobile sim cards or 1 at&t sim card specifically for data plus 1 t-mobile sim card for talk and text.
##metallic back cover is not that high quality as i thought.
##it's not all made with metal, and feels flimsy.
[t]Excellent phone, great battery life

[t]It's a better buy than G5 plus US version
##it's a better buy than g5 plus us version.
##it's hard to find among budget phones nowadays besides honor 5x for a phone with dual-sim, dual lte comptible with at&t and t-mobile, dedicated micro-sd card, and one with replaceable battery.
##that being said, onlyl honor 5x has all the above features, but honor 5x has been out there for two years and the new us version honor doesn't have those features in one anymore.
##if you care about the features that i mentioned, you will agree with me why this is the king of the budget phone 2017.  though this is not the us version, it works with all us gsm carriers.
##it looks like an iphone 6 with front fingerprint scanner.
##i got this case with kickstand from ebay (for-motorola-moto-g5-xt1671-black-gt-armor-case-dual-layer-holster-impact-cover) .
##it works out nicely.
##i am waiting for a tempered glass screen protector now and will take good care of it.
##time to sell my honor 5x...  after 3 months of use, the phone is partially broken.
##it has experienced ghost touch (feel like someone else is clicking your phone) and after that the row of screen near rocker (volumne up) won't respond to touch.
##as a result, this hurts the functionality of many apps.
##the rest functions still work, but i am out of luck for repair since it's not us version and motoorola is not covering us repair under the warantee contract.
##i saw there are many complain on the ghost touch issue and i tried all fixes even factory reset.
##i believe it's an hardware issue since that row of the screen near rocker key is hot and the factory reset didn't help.
##now i changed my mind and gave this a two star.
[t]Second SIM is useless because it is only 2G
##the second sim has only 2g connectivity.
##this makes it useless in the us on networks like at&t which no longer use 2g.
##also, the phone i received was very slow at answering phone calls even for the primary sim and very often it would not ring and miss the call completely.
##i am glad i was able to return the phone.

[t]Great phone for travel anywhere in the world ...
##this is a great sim card phone for travel.
##because it has two sim card slots one can be as a world phone for example with a onesim card that allows you to be reached anywhere.
##the 2nd slot can be used for local sim cards to make calls in specific countries cheap.
##my last trip i used both an iraq and jordan sim card for local calls and the onesim card for calls back to the usa.
##of course, in a hotel with wifi, viber or similar voip call can be made free or very cheaply.
##when making a call or sending a text the unit gives the option of sim cards to use.
##inbound calls are handled by the sim card that was called.
##this is a true android phone with 32 gb.
##a real buy at just over $200.
##warning: there is no usa warranty so don't drop it and expect a replacement as can be done at verizon of att.

##there is very little noticeable lag.
##i upgraded from a moto g2.
##nougat has some nice features.
##i haven't used the fingerprint reader - but it's nice to have.

##the 'moto ' app allowed me to pretty easily to swap devices taking my apps with me so that saved me a good bit  of time.
##very decent battery life.
##here are my major issues which made me deduct 2 stars.
##1. the speaker phone volume is too low :@.

##when i plug into my externally powered book shelf speakers at home, at max volume on the phone, it is only maybe half of what it would have been with the g2.

##and i may now be forced to get a thin rubber case just for that reason!
##4.  the micro sd card slot is tricky!
##it is not intuitive as to how far it needs to go in and at the first attempt i think i shoved mine in too far, and it looks like i damaged the pins inside the slot so now it doesn't read my sd card.
##so buyers be very careful when inserting your sd card.
##it does not go in all the way.
##at least the onboard 32gb (24 gb free) makes up for me not having an sd card in.

[t]Dual Sim, Removable Battery; Better Phone Than Moto G4
##notice:  just discovered that this phone uses the same battery (gk40) as the moto g4 play.
##it is not yet being offered by amazon for the moto g5, but it is for the moto g4 play so easy to replace your g5 battery when necessary.
##i'm very happy with this phone (it replaces a moto g4 "standard version").
##among the reasons:  1.  dual sim.
##i am an expat in the dominican republic and in the past i have been traveling with 2 phones when going to the us.
##now i just have to move a couple sliders as the plane nears either country to begin making calls as soon as plane lands.
##2.  i like having a removable battery even though i might not keep the phone until the battery dies.
##but you never know.
##at least now i am assured that if the battery dies prematurely i can replace it  3.  the print reader is a plus for me.
##with the g4, to put the phone to sleep i had to short press the power button then to wake it up i again short pressed the power button and put in my 4 digit password.
##with this phone, once it is turned on i don't need to press the power button for anything until i am ready to turn it off.
##to put it to sleep i just press the print reader, then to wake it i just press the print reader again.
##the phone wakes up immediately and is ready for business.
##this phone is a bit smaller than the g4.
##i liked the size of the g4, but this phone feels good in my and the size difference doesn't bother me as much as i thought it would.
##i have read reviews about annoying background noises when you are on a call, but i don't experience that.
##i get very good reception and the people i talk with say they can hear me clearly,  without noise or distortion,  and the volume is good.
##i am happy with the camera, too.
##it is as good or better than the one on my g4.
##the saturation is a little better, too.
##when you set up the camera you are asked if you  want rich color or natural.
##i chose natural, but still the color is a bit richer than on my g4.
##not over saturated, however.
##the pictures look good and i don't have to do as much editing on the camera as i did with the g4.
##i think the video is a bit better, too.
##a little more color and a bit sharper.
##i sent a clip to someone i chat with and she commented very positively about the new phone based on the video.
##the sim cards are smaller on this phone than the g4, nano size, and where you put them is different.
##there is a good illustration of where they go in a little user guide that comes with the phone but the guide is in spanish.
##apparently this international version  was designated for spanish a speaking country.
##however,there are short videos on youtube showing what goes where and what to do it that will make it all clear for you if you don't read spanish.
##i do but still found the videos helpful.
##the screen is brighter and the colors are richer.
##i find it more appealing to the eye.
##the phone comes with only 32 gb of storage, however, i put in a 128 gb sd card and added it to internal storage.
##now i am loaded for bear and will likely do more with movies and videos than i did with the g4.
##i can't move it between phones since it is in internal storage, but when i get a new phone i can format it and use it in that phone.
##i wasn't sure if i should spend the money for the g5 since the g4 was only a year old.
##but i really wanted a dual sim phone and now i have that as well as other things i didn't have on the g4.

##this was not a new product.
##it was missing some of the internal packaging, came with a samsung charging cable and clearly had fingerprints all over the phone.
##also, instructions are in spanish and you have to go to motorola's international site in order to find english instructions.
##the sim card and sd card requires you to remove the back of the phone which is not too difficult.

[t]An affordable Dual-Sim phone with some puzzling missing features
##the moto g5 was bought  to replace my aging nuu x4, once i realized that early promises of upgrades to android os in the latter were not going to materialize.
##the g5 is faster than my old phone, and has better battery life, and also more storage space, so it's hard not to like it.
##it also uses android 7, so the more granular permissions control is very nice.
##on the other hand, there are a number of gaps that are hard to understand.
##one of the first things i ran into was that it doesn't have a magnetometer.
##now, that may not mean anything to you, but it means that the phone doesn't have the ability to act as a compass.
##as a result, navigation programs are limited, because they don't know what direction i'm facing.
##there are also a number of sweet programs that don't work as well if you can't determine a heading with the phone's hardware.
##because i wanted the dual sim capability, my phone is an international model, and while everything else is in english, the system upgrade notification is in spanish.
##that's a little awkward for me, though not impossible to deal with.
##most of the other limitations relate to things that motorola does or doesn't include with their software.
##it's taken a while to get used to, but nothing serious.
##will i recommend the moto g5, or buy another one?
##hard to say.
##the price was very attractive (a big part of the reason i bought it) but some of the missing features have been frustrating.
##i may need to try something from another vendor before i decide if moto will get me back.
##the plethora of cheap phones makes it hard to sort out the trash from the gems, and budget-sensitive buyers like me often get squeezed by not having all of the information available.
[t]Terrible

##my husband loves his new phone.
##it loads apps quickly.
[t]perfect price and fast delivery it's good
##basic performance , perfect price and fast delivery it's good deal
[t]Good price and good Camera
##can't complain this phone is amazing except don't try to put too much apps on it or else it's becomes very laggy and slow.
##i bought this phone because of the inexpensive price and also it's dual sim cards feature-- the best of both worlds.
##would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to stay on a focused budget the camera is almost very good as well plus love the quick charging ability not to be confused with fast charging.
[t]WIFI Authentication Error No Matter What You Do
##much bigger than i thought, takes up half a purse.
##won't connect to my wifi and tried numerous help sites and suggestions.
##the price is right if you just want to get/make call and send emails.
##not much help if you need to use wifi though.
##would not purchase again.

##good product it came in excellent conditions
[t]Ads, ads, ads!
##popup ads drive me crazy!
##they interrupt when playing audible books.
##they play everytime the screen timeout occurs.
##i like the phone, but cannot recommend it with these constant ads.
[t]Fingerprint Sensor wasn't working
##i did received this item in chile some time ago, it was delivered on time, and everything was in its place inside the box, a brand new phone.
##i turned it on, configured it and i noticed that it didn't ask about the finger print sensor's configuration, so i tried to use it...it was not working... did a complete reset and nothing changed... it did auto-update and tried again... nothing.
##i am having a refund after a lot of days... will buy an honor 7x instead =)

[t]Fine Choice for a medium priced phone.
##had this phone a week.
##it is the real deal.
##a good solid motorola product.
##cool ringtones with it.
##great functionality.
##i am happy with this purchase.
[t]I'm not really good at all this and it's taken me this long ...
##trying to talk to someone.
##this phone is not even supported in the us.
##i'm not really good at all this and it's taken me this long to figure it all out.
##please someone help me!?!
##?
[t]great buy
##this is a great phone for the cost.
##consider buying this phone if you want a newer smartphone, but shudder when at the thought of spending 800$+^ on a device you could potentially break.
##this phones instructions are in portuguese so if that's a problem for you beware.
##only complaint i have is the icons are a bit big.
[t]Not my favorite, but a decent phone... if you like being completely integrated with Google.
##it's not a bad phone, but i don't like that it's so integrated with google that i can't seem to chose apps that are independent of google.
##ok, so there are some good things.
##performance is acceptable, camera is good for the price.
##the speakers are also alright.
##takes a long time to load from my micro sd card, which is very annoying.
##dual sim works well.
##personally, i liked my lg dual sim and acer triple sim (yes, they make a triple sim phone) better.
##i have to admit, though, this moto has better style and branding.
##performance isn't as good as an alcatel idol 4s, which isn't as expensive!
##it's also a hybrid dual sim.
##you just pay more for the moto brand.
[t]Super happy with my purchase
##i am happy with my purchase, everything was quick and easy, i bought the equipment with amazon suggestions of a case and a protective glass and everything was perfect and custom-made.
##the equipment arrived sealed to venezuela, with all the contents in the box in perfect condition.
##so far there are no problems with the equipment
[t]Defective unit
##purchased this and it didn't work out of the box - the phone doesn't boot (it flickered on the motorola splash screen).
##unacceptable for a brand new phone!
##i'm returning this and requesting a refund.
[t]It's just a phone, but a really good one.
##this is a great phone.
##light weight, decent design, decent camera, good display, long battery life, good network receptors.
##it has everything i wanted in a phone.
##with the lag we get in apple phones, i would say this phone is a 1000 dollars cheaper with pretty much everything you would ever need in a phone.
[t]Lots of limitations
##phone has lots of defects.
##you can't send or receive text messages with bluetooth.
##you also can't transfer photos or data to a pc using a usb connection (old phone allowed you to change usb settings from charging only to mtp mode - transfer data or photos--this one does not!)
##motorola assistance is of no help.
[t]One Star
##stopped working on third day, i applied for a refund.
##don't buy any phone on amazon, all are defective
[t]Really good phone - weird language settings issue
##it's a quality mid-range phone.
##our son had a 2nd generation moto g that lasted him for over 2 years, so i went with a brand that really worked for him.
##this one has more snappy performance, bigger storage, and a better screen (though it still gets nowhere near the visuals of my galaxy s8).
##the listing is very clear that this is the international version.
##we use t-mobile and haven't had any problems with connection or for lte compatibility.
##however, all of the update notifications and system-based messages like that are in spanish.
##even with all language settings set to english, you'll still randomly come across something in spanish.
##there's no way i can see for changing this over...

##excellent
[t]and looks like that's not an option
##i would not buy this phone again.
##it's an international version, which is included in the description but i didn't understand the implications of what that means.
##i had to change service providers and i have zero bars in my home.
##it is not compatible with verizon or sprint and does not not work with straight talk.
##i cannot figure out how to use wi-fi calling, and looks like that's not an option.
##i keep getting notices from motorola but i think they are in spanish which i can't read.
##i am sorry i bought this phone.
##i don't think i can return it, because i scratched the case trying to open it up.
##two thumbs down from me.
[t]Great bang for your buck
##everything fine!
##nice phone
[t]Not better than it's predecessor (Moto G4)
##the smartphone is ok for a midrange if you don't want to spend much, but it falls short to it's predecessor.
##<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/moto-g-4th-gen-unlocked-white-32gb/dp/b01dzjfybw/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">moto g (4th gen.) unlocked - white - 32gb</a>provided a more comfortable experience with it 5.2'' display and neat design.
##this one feels like going back to moto g2 and there's little to gain: the fingerprint reader and i think the camera has better autofocus.
##i'd either stick with previous version or move to a higher range.
[t]All good, great graphics and res with AMOLED screen
##rec'd the phone earlier than expected.
##in factory sealed original packaging w/charging usb/plug and instructions [in espanol-this is an "international version" and is stated on ad this way.
##no worries, onto net and found english translation but still had a long review of virtual and physical planes before snapping out the nano sim!
##all good, great graphics and res with amoled screen.
##so far all systems go!
##i was advised to use the phone with us sim/carrier for at least a 5 min call from us phone# prior to connecting any other countries sim to use overseas.
##so once i have reached my 1st destination i will update if necessary.
##a nice big screen, easy to use software and lots of whistles and bells for a great pirce!
##ciao
[t]DON',T DO IT!!!!!!
##this is one of the worst purchases i have ever made.
##they're swiping down at the bottom is horrid doesn't work half the time.
##phone shuts down, weak and slow, doesn't even get a good signal.
##it's very very frustrating to use.
##i made the mistake of purchasing this and should have returned it but got  busy.
##now i'm paying.
##if you want to make even the most simplest tasks difficult and frustrating by this phone if you don't add a few dollars extra and go to the popular model like i was told to do.
##not sure what any of these good reviews are but i'm telling you don't do it!
##even as i write this review it's a headache.
##went on to bid for anorher phone, lost because the dumb swiper button below, then it shut down....dam!!!!
##!
[t]Not fully compatible with T-Mobile as stated. Does not ...
##not fully compatible with t-mobile as stated.
##does not support volte, so you are out of luck wherever lte band 12 is the only deployed network.
[t]You better not bother i guess..
##the charging port quit working the day after the product support window closed on amazon, good job ensuring a product would fail right after all warranty options expired so im out $200

##very well priced phone with nice screen and good battery life for social media activities and it has quick charge.
##has an ok camera but for the price it's expected.
##it does have a very quick and nice to feel fingerprint reader.
##fits big in hand has speaker which is quite low.
##will give a long term review later
[t]Fantastic upgrade from MotoG3
##i love this phone; i had a 3rd generation and this is such an improvement!!!!
##i enjoy having a phone again; i struggled way too long with the old phone.
##so far, i have added apps i had to delete from old phone and i haven't even started to use up memory!
##the camera is so much less frustrating.
##i have used a samsung and am so glad i decided to stay with motorola brand!
##it is a good size; feels sturdy.
##i bought a case and it's a perfect combo.i it's only been a few days but i highly recommend this phone.
[t]Works great. I'm happy with my purchase
##works great.

##it satisfied my expectations, cmara quality isn't perfect
[t]Perfect Size:  Works great with Ting
##perfect size.
##my husband wanted something smaller than my g5s plus but bigger than his old e4 and this 5" phone is perfect.
##this one is the latin america version which carries all t-mobile bands (2,4,12) so it works perfect for us on ting.
##it has a full 1080 screen rather than the e4 720 and he can text one handed unlike the g5s plus.
##it downloaded the august 2017 android security patch on booting and runs nougat so no complaints.
##and as a non carrier phone you can access 25gb of the 32gb on the phone as there is no bloatware.
[t]Mobile Hotspot did not work.
##the mobile hotspot did not work on this phone.
##i travel a lot and need to use the hotspot for my laptop frequently.
##i use at&t and they were very helpful and spent an hour with me going through different settings, renaming networks etc.
##no dice.
##called motorola and they were less than helpful.offered me another phone, but i either had to wait six to ten business days or pay a twenty-five dollar fee to have them front me one.
##i would have been glad for them to put a hold on my cc, but a twenty five dollar fee to replace a faulty phone chafes a little.
##i returned it and bought an unlocked g5s plus.
##it works great, but it is too big.
##i really like the size of the g5, but the more i read it looks like the hotspot is a problem with a good portion of the g5 phones.
[t]Hello mofo
##cool phone but i don't know i was happier with my moto g1 this phone didnt make me happy but didnt make me sad
[t]Good phone cheap.
##i bought to replace my revered nexus 5, whose battery was giving signs of old age.
##i have been using it on t-mobile for two weeks, and:  - it works as a phone.
##- it sends and receives texts, including with pictures.
##- it works as a camera.
##- it works as a road atlas.
##- it works as a newspaper.
##- it goes four or five days between charges (be sure to whitelist the sms app in the battery saver).
##- it displays 1080p hd.
##- it doesn't pester me with notifications i don't want (so far).
##- i have two spare batteries (purchased separately) which swap out in seconds.
##- it supports an up to 128 gb sd card, either as encrypted, integrated system storage, or as "external" media storage.
##- the "moto" software is very light and unobtrusive, and adds real functionality.
##- it has a headphone jack, which accommodates earbuds like the ones i already have all over the place.
##- it uses usb connectors and chargers like the ones i already have all over the place.
##- it has a working analog fm receiver.
##- it cost me less than $200.
##i am proud of myself for finding and buying this phone.
[t]Ideal cheap unlocked travel smartphone.
##the uk motorola site has an english manual in pdf format.
##this phone has a removable battery.
##it has two sim slots and an sd card slot.
##it sheds water and can survive a dunking.
##what more do you need?
[t]It is a terrific workhorse of a phone
##i actually got the 64gb version which may or may not be available currently.
##have been using for 7 months.
##it is a terrific workhorse of a phone.
##i have two minor beefs: 1. the camera doesn't always boot up reliably on the shake motion; 2. the screen feels not quite as sharply black and white as my old moto x and (oddly) as my kid's moto e.  both of these are minor issues.
##this phone is incredible for the price and i would highly recommend it to anyone.

[t]Great value. Great battery life. Not too big.
##very satisfied.
##very good phone at great price.
##battery life is stellar for now and is easily replaceable when it gets older.
##love the fingerprint reader.
##size is just right.
##it's not a glass and titanium work of art flagship, but it's a very competent model at a quarter of the price.
[t]Camera doesn't focus well.
##the camera takes a few seconds to think before taking a picture.
##you'd think that was to focus, but it's not.
##i also cannot figure out why i can't send or receive texts from iphones.
##i give up.
##returned within two weeks.
