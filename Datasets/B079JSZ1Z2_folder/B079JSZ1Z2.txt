##perfect phone.
##keep running the notch guy in the commercials lol.
[t]Be careful to select the right colour of the device.
##product was exactly as described.
##love using this device!
[t]Deficient in features "BEWARE"......
##beware, this unlocked phone does not have advanced calling or video calling capability.
##went from a s7 to this s9 & went backwards in features.
##the seller info should declare these deficiencies in their sales pitch.
[t]Five star!
##very nice!
##perfect quality!
[t]It is an awesome one!
##it is an awesome one!!!!!
##now able to use it more easy yeah.
##the battery is lasting me much longer, if i do not use it all the time, i do not need to charge it until the the next.
##is is easy to set it up and get all your data back on.
[t]Touchscreen nav bar died
##i was very happy at first with my purchase, as this is a very powerful phone.
##but, seems that there's a growing issue in which areas of the screen die and get unresponsive.
##in my case it was the navigation bar, but other people in forums have this same issue in different areas of the touchscreen too.

##the phone is perfect  am wowed
[t]Great phone, buy it!
##this is a great phone.
##i just upgraded from an htc phone & the galaxy s9 plus makes it look like a toy.
##i'm in a not so great service area & so far so good.
##i also had problems with wi-fi in my house with the other phone & so far have had no issues with that.
[t]Top cellphone in the marketplace
##after doing research on pros/cons of top 4 popular smartphones in the marketplace (including iphone x, sony xz2, huawei mate 10 pro, and s9+), i finally made the purchase decision and ordered s9+.
##i am satisfied with the phone.
##it provides several super powerful features to improve experience of daily usage.
##only one improvement which samsung could make is to seal product boxes to protect customer's experience of unboxing.

##i love this phone.
[t]Five Stars
##wonderful, elegant, fast, the colors in the screen are amazing
[t]Superb!
##i've been a fan of the galaxy series, both tablets and phones, having extensive experience with the s5, s6, s8 and now the s9+.
##the s9+ has dual rear-facing cameras, a first in the series.
##this feature alone was worth upgrading as i'm an avid amateur photographer with several nice dslr cameras, but face it, i take far more photos with my phone simply because it's always with me.
##transitioning from the s8 to s9+ took an hour but was smooth as silk.
##*everything* transferred automatically - apps, pics, files, settings - including the kitchen sink.
##lol  i highly recommend - 5 golden stars!
[t]Five Stars
##awesome phone
[t]Flawed software - Wait for an update ... !
##after years of not using samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, i finally gave it a shot with the s9 plus.
##unfortunately, i had to return the device next day.
##the good:  samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique.
##i especially fell in love with the dex feature.
##being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing.
##i first got introduced to this kind of feature on a huawei mate 10 pro (which i also had to return for other reasons).
##once i actually got exposed to the dex, i knew i wanted it in my life.
##samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled!
##i doubt i have to say more.
##:)  the camera was ok. for some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion.
##compared to my pixel 2 xl pictures, the ones taken with the samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details.
##in this days and age, that's nitpicking, i know.
##all top tier phones take great pictures.
##it doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department.
##the "doesn't matter much but still annoying":  samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot.
##i still don't really care for it but i could at least have lived with it.
##i hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them.
##for instance wifi calling.
##why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under network and connectivity?
##pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back.
##granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the os?
##i know i can disable an app, however, i would prefer if it isn't there in the first place!
##samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive.
##why do i need a samsung clock app that doesn't do any more than the default android clock app?
##why do i need a samsung phone app where the default android phone app is just fine?
##same goes for samsung mail, samsung calendar and a bunch more.
##if i could at least remove them and replace them with the stock android apps, i would be more inclined to buy a samsung phone.
##bixby is a whole other story!
##from the get-go, i had no intention of using samsung's assistant.
##yet, here she was, right in my face.
##i could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely.
##i remembered that the bixby button (which i hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated.
##yeah, sure!
##you first have to create a samsung account, then configure bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in bixby and deactivate the hardware button.
##i don't know who thought of this nonsense!
##as mentioned, i would have been able to live with the above.
##annoying (to me), yes, but i could live with it.
##the bad:  the most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception!
##i got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. i constantly lost network.
##researching this problem online, i learnt that this has been an issue with all of samsung's high end devices since the oreo update.
##the forums across the globe are filled with user complaints.
##the german samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the s8, s8+, note 8, s9 and s9+.
##this has been going on since february, it seems.
##users state that their phones were fine with android 7.x but since the oreo update, everything is a mess.
##strangely, this also affects wifi calling, too.
##i wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls.
##there are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work.
##samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem.
##instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device.
##if that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me!
##in between, samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem.
##regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, i returned mine.

[t]Best phone
##what a machine!!!
##best phone ever
[t]I love my new phone
##i love my new phone.
##it is the right size and easy to handle for my smaller hands.
##i enjoy using the "swipe" feature on this phone as it can be done with one hand.
##the phone is very responsive.
##i haven't had it long enough to learn all the features, but so far, it has worked wonderfully and met my expectations.
[t]... upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week
##recently upgraded from the s7 to the s9+ and i'm terribly disappointed.
##last week, i decided to upgrade from a samsung s7 to a samsung s9+.
##i even went all in with the bogo deal from verizon and upgraded junior at the same time.
##rarely have i been so disappointed in a tech purchase!
##and samsung, i hope you have people watching for this sort of post.
##i'll be returning.
##this.
##phone.
##tomorrow.
##major shortcomings include "bixby," microphone placement, and voice recognition.
##first, the "bixby" personal assistant is a train wreck.
##i don't know who decided that an unholy union of the yahoo!
##home page and google assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark.
##and it can't.
##be.
##disabled.
##nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.
##second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless.
##seriously, samsung?!
##the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.
##thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal.
##these features worked nearly flawlessly on my s7, but on the s9+ i'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone "hears" when i talk to it.
##i have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good.
##even if i shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, i can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words.
##i spend 50-60 hours per week driving and must be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible.
##swing and a resounding miss, samsung.
[t]Love it
##everything works great
[t]Amazing phone, bundle a plus
##what else can i say about this wonderful phone that has not already been said?
##i always get black phones and this time i decided to go for the fun option, lilac.
##the color is gorgeous and serves to accentuate the phone's beauty.
##my carrier is metropcs, and while i was unable to activate it online, i called their support line and was up and running in 15 minutes.
##i will add that i purchased the bundle and it's a great deal.
##the iconx alone are more than the added cost of the bundle.
##the wireless charger is fun and convenient; no more yanked cords or poor charging in a year because of a broken charge port.

[t]Bad Battery Life
##just wanted to comment that the battery life is terrible.
##samsung has had several years to correct the battery issue and has yet to do so.
[t]CAMERA is Straight FIRREEE(bomb)
##bomb.com  i upgraded from an s7 to the 9+ and i love it, its so many things you can do on this phone and i still don't know everything but for the most part i don't regret spending all this money on a phone and wait let me tell you this camera on this phone is straight fireeee, its so clear and i'm making my youtube videos with this as well.
##samsung you did this
[t]The operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my Panasonic Lumix
##this is my third samsung galaxy after switching from the original iphone.
##this was a huge upgrade from my galaxy alpha.
##the operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my panasonic lumix.
##my wife's galaxy s8 seems just about the same but the 9 is noticeably zippier but i have way fewer apps.
##in our household we have macs, pc's, ipads, roku's, tablets so we aren't married to any particular brand.
##for the phones i've enjoyed samsungs.
##my wife got a deal on an lg and it was a big headache as it had hardware failures.
##important, currently, as of this writing the s9 has a software problem where notifications on the apps does not work.
##since i've come to rely on those little numbers on the top left corner of my apps this is an inconvenience.
##my old samsung came with svoice which i prefer over bixby for simplicity but it's slowly winning me over.
##ask bixby to rap for you, it's hilarious.
[t]Five Stars
##i would like to try the product for free because i always wanna one.
[t]Four Stars
##everything about samsung galaxy s9 is awesome except my volume controls were not functioning sorry 4 stars
[t]Cost vs Performance a Plus
##probably the best phone i've purchased in a long time.
##would definitely recommend to someone looking for an upgrade, especially if they don't want to pay more for similar performance on something like, say, the iphone x. i almost bought an iphone, and after looking at them both i decided to go with the s9 and i am glad i did.
##the display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory.
##the speed of the phone is high, even if you have a lot of apps open, probably due to the 4 gb ram.
##superb performance overall.
##impressed me for sure.
[t]Beautiful Phone!
##i upgraded from a s6 edge+, and i'm a samsung girl for life.
##this phone ran beautifully right from the get-go.
##it's not too bulky, i have no problems using it with one hand.
##the camera is awesome.
##i've been playing with it since i got it out of the box!
##i'm still getting used to the new operating system and layout.
##i've been used to the galaxy's home button, and the back and multi-screen buttons, so it's interesting adapting to a completely smooth device.
##where the apps icon was on the home screen, is now the camera icon.
##if you're upgrading like i did, you have to flick upwards to get to the apps.
##but this is not, in any way, a downside.
##the speakers are great, and listening to music through earphones is awesome.
##i absolutely love this new phone!
##i definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone!
[t]Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far
##i am a die hard apple person.
##all my desktop computers at home are apple, my other 4 family members all have iphones and we have laptops that are all apple.
##not really sure why i decided to try out the samsung galaxy s9+ but happy that i did so far.
##i was using a 4 1/2 year old iphone 5s so i figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world.
##it still takes a little getting used to coming from the ios system's way of doing things.
##i do lose the capability of imessage and facetime.
##not a huge deal and i can use the duo app from google which is the same as facetime.
##the key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great.
##i like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration).
##i think the new iphone x does this too but again, i'm coming from a 5s.
##my only two choices for a new phone were this s9+ or keep on with apple and get an iphone x. the x would have cost me $1150 plus an applecare warranty for $200.
##i got this samsung (and got the ultimate play bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle.
##took out a square trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should i need to use it.
##i have used square trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee.
##square trade is owned by allstate so i have confidence in them.
##getting back to the phone, the s9+ seems to work very fast when loading apps and pages.
##i use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (nest thermostat, wireless cameras, lifx lights, liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly.
##the audio when playing music sounds great.
##plays very loud and clear for a phone.
##i like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack.
##i like the android system as it comes with google assistant voice command.
##most people hate the bixby feature on this phone.
##my only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume i accidentally hit bixby sometimes.
##i do like though that i's voice activated.
##i get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up bixby and command it to open up whatever app i need (usually waze).
##once open, i speak to waze to take me to work.
##all of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road.
##also, the bixby ai camera function is very cool too.
##there are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera.
##like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to english or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone).
##point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count.
##point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...).
##the only thing i think i will never use again and of course i tried it out is the animoji of myself or any of my friends.
##it's scary weird.
##everyone looks the same on this.
##i would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3d type and look more realistic.
##i have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others.
##mot notably the iphone x. in my opinion, the x does do a lot of pix better.
##the contrast is usually better.
##the real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit.
##so, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iphone x. the only thing i had to get used to is the colors on a samsung phone are very oversaturated.
##colors are very bright.
##there is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view.
##i turned it down to one of them and it now looks a lot more realistic.
##i like the fact that this phone, as well as the iphone x, features ability to record video at 4k 60fps.
##looks great.
##on the samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4k 60fps.
##keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue.
##for all other video formats, the stabilization on the samsung works better than the x. all in all, i am happy i went with the samsung.
##in a few months if i regret it, i can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iphone x plus.
##update: 4/7/2018.
##the voice unlock code is terrible.
##and, after searching through the options on the phone i came to the conclusion i don't need it.
##i have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back.
##i actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use.
##battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now.
##one thing i find annoying that i didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting.
##whether i send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all.
##this is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space.
##i was used to having an iphone and using imessage.
##send any size video to someone else with an iphone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text.
##not so with android.
##now this is not just samsung but all android phones.
##so, for now, i have to send videos via whatsapp or viber (or a number of other text apps).
##they do compress but not horribly.
##oh, and one more note.
##i hope samsung corp is reading this review.
##the samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people i have ever dealt with for a tech company.
##i used to think comcast was bad until i called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at samsung.
##they just repeat my question and tell me they understand how i feel offering absolutely no answers.
##they put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve.
##just terrible customer service.
##180 degrees from dealing with someone at applecare when i had a question about my iphone or imac computer.
##2nd update: i didn't  realize this and this is very important to know before purchasing.
##in fact, i'm on the at&t network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this.
##the sales people in best buy in the phone department did not know this either.
##when you buy an unlocked galaxy s9 or s9+, your phone is $840.
##if however you want to buy it thru at&t for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it.
##meaning, the unlocked phone will not have: wifi calling option, hd audio option, vvm (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling.
##the option for these features is not even on my phone.
##now, you can buy the at&t phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone).
##after you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the at&t phone unlocked and then you will have these features.
##nowhere at best buy or any at&t store do they tell you this.
##in my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing.
##i picked up the bundle package here on amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so i'm keeping my setup.
##i just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get.
##i figured the at&t version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed.
##hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features.
##and, i went to the at&t store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone.
##there isn't.
##they cannot update your phone to get these options.
##3rd update: april 15th, 2018 i discovered a great feature today.
##i wish these galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iphone x has.
##you pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go.
##what i discovered is setting the google assistant to open the galaxy even from the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the google assistant to do.
##love this feature immensely.
##4th update april 23, 2018 as i play around more with this phone, i am learning some cool things it can do.
##for instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray.
##no need for repetition with swiping either up or down.
##there is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you.
##even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier).
##also, one thing samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate.
##now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control media volume no matter what you are viewing.
##and, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the media volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them.
##apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the galaxy phones that is now solved.

[t]Slick Performance & Exterior
##i'm upgrading from a bricked nexus 5x so the performance and feel of this phone is leaps and bounds beyond what i'm used to.
##i've been using google phones for a number of years so i was concerned about samsung wrecking the ui.
##but after disabling bixby and its button, it's pretty much back to working like vanilla android as far as i'm concerned.
##i like the "infinity screen" for the fact that it increases screen size without greatly increasing the size of the phone.
##my 5x is only a bit smaller than the s9+!
##my biggest complaint, and the reason i'm giving 4/5 stars is for the exterior feel of this phone - it's very very slippery!
##the 5x has a rubberized coating that makes it easy to pick up and hold and also not slide off of surfaces, i greatly miss that.
##for example when i navigate while driving i put the phone on my right knee.
##this new phone immediately slides right off.
##i'm definitely going to get some kind of case or grippy skin for it.

[t]Defective phone
##i had the s8 and screens were slipping and sliding/opening and closing.
##that was resolved either with an update or one of many calls to verizon (don't recall.)
##also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning.
##my boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and i could hear much better.
##but i had already ordered the s9 since i didn't think we could fix the audio on the s8.
##i'm having so many issues with it.
##i was on the phone with verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs.
##after exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that i got a defective phone!
##what are the odds?
##when i try to google, email or text, i get knocked out into home screen.
##very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text.
##perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive.
##it's not the apps - we put it in safe mode.
##we changed everything around including samsung keyboard to gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't.
##i'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review.
##aren't i the lucky one?
##i think i'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone.
##new phone arriving tomorrow and will go to verizon store for set up as i did with this phone.
##wish me luck please!
##thanks.

[t]Samsung unveiled its Beast S9 plus for 2018
##i have upgraded from s8 plus and i really see an improvement in the performance , especially camera, ar emoji and face detection features are awesome.
[t]Good phone
##had problems activating it through verizon but finally got it.
##great camera.
##pretty much the same as a  s8 with a few cool upgrades.
[t]Phone worth purchasing upgraded from the s5 model
##i upgraded from the s5, and i can tell you that the phone is the best phone on the market currently.
##i've been a loyal samsung customer for years, and when i hold a phone for long term use i really keep it until something is worth purchasing.
##where the iphone lacks the s9 plus makes up for.
##the ram, expandable storage option of 400 gb's, and beautiful display, & somewhat ok price(the more advance the more expensive technology will be) places the phone already ahead of many phone companies.
##samsung truly improved upon the phone, and i can say i'm satisfied.
[t]Better than expected!
##coming over from a nexus 6p and i'm starting to realize how outdated my phone really was.
##the screen on this phone is amazing.
##camera is awesome, and the headphones that come with the box are surprisingly decent.
##the phone and its settings are very customizable and that's something i really love.
##the resolution on the phone is absolutely beautiful.
##one of the best displays that i've ever seen.
##battery life is pretty good so far as well.
##going to continue playing playing around with the phone and provide updates to whatever happens either positive or negative with my phone.
##but so far it's great!

[t]Compared to my last phone it's a dream come true
##like the title says... i was using an iphone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago.
##i'll break down what i like and do not like about this phone though: pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps i use as well as the internet.
##if has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it.
##(honestly i highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.)
##the sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what i had before.
##cons: the phone is much heavier than what i am used to or what i had expected.
##the camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iphone) when you zoom in.
##the price for the phone was about average.
##i found this to be a better deal than the google xl 2, or the iphone x which in my opinion were both overpriced, however i still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies.
##lastly, if you are an ios user and are considering switching to android like i did, heed my warning, because i can't put this in larger letters if i tried: do not forget to deactivate your imessages.
##if you do not deactivate them, you will not be able to receive imessages (texts) from any iphone or ipad user.
##i ran into a huge issue with this and even though i was incredibly careful, i still had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue.
##all in all, i am very happy with my purchase.
##p.s.
##: note that if you are changing from ios to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing.
##i had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. android using google and facebook.
##i highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.
[t]Oof
##love it so far, earphones are the biggest downside to it, that look pathetically made and sound bad but overall the phone itself is a beauty

##so far i like it.
##when i first opened the box today i was a little disappointed because it looked a little small for someone who was used to an lg g5 (yes, i am one of those few who actually loved the g5), but after customizing it and playing around with it for a few hours, i love it!
##glad i went with this model instead of the plus.
##amazon actually shipped the phone two days early too, which i also really appreciate.
[t]The touch sensor is lightning fast compared to the s7 and the iris/face scanner is bad either. The one biggest complaint I have is ...
##i upgraded from my galaxy s7 and the s9 is a very refreshing experience so far.
##very fast and responsive.
##i was hesitant at first because it doesn't have a home button but i have completely forgot about it already.
##the touch sensor is lightning fast compared to the s7 and the iris/face scanner is bad either.
##the one biggest complaint i have is the bixby button which they don't let you remap.
[t]Love it!
##upgraded from the s6.
##love it!
##fingerprint on back is cool and hidden home button is good too.
##activated verizon set up all online super easy.
##i bought a caseology case and screen protector.
##needed to change the touch screen sensitivity to make it normal (for a while it was difficult to type).
[t]I hate this phone
##i just got this phone through my work.
##i've owned the galaxy 4,5, and 7, so i figured i'd stay with the same brand and get the s9.
##i've had it only a few days, and the screen is so unresponsive when clicking and scrolling and apps are spontaneously shutting down.
##i do love the creativity behind this and camera features, but getting the darn thing to work is quite frustrating.
[t]Completely broken notifications. Curved glass is a disaster. Excellent display.
##i am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.
##i use lg, pixel and iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon samsung long time ago.
##every cheap lg just worked better than samsung for me.
##decided to try s9  due it's small size; the only other option was google pixel but its display is just too bad.
##the only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display.
##heck, except in youtube, the buttons are always  there, making that 5" screen more like 4.5", in a body that's wider than s9.
##what a nonsense..  anyway, s9 notifications:  no notifications on locked screen:  i have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then i'll see notifications.
##iphone/pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, i can see if it's anything interesting, if not i go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.
##limited notifications on locked screen: shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone.
##some settings available that don't help much.
##androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications.
##if you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.
##raise to wakeup and show notifications: with iphone/pixel/nexus, i would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing  notifications.
##as soon as i put the phone down the screen goes off.
##when i pickup s9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...  notifications while using the phone: some message comes in, the phone does nothing.
##sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup.
##all this regardless of notification sounds settings and silent mode.
##wtf ?
##app icon number: not reliably cleared or set on google inbox, outlook, google play, to name a few.
##note: some of these problems are tied to notification sound being off.
##so, they tied together sound and visual part of the notification system.
##maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between visual and sound notifications in  settings.
##naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.
##samsung knows that but they failed to get it right.
##it's understandable why they failed - read below about the sw update i got.
##anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g.
##after i change different options) but then get broken again.
##classical samsung...  all in all, i am relying on my pebble to show me notifications.
##some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent.
##so why samsung doesn't care ?
##well, just two days into preorder (i already got my phone) and i get software update with important bug fixes.
##so, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs.
##they start lots of things, and  rarely nail a single one.
##first crazy option: edge screen notifications.
##you got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what.
##second crazy  option: turn on screensaver when screen is off.
##it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ?
##wtf ?
##third crazy option: always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that i have notifications... sure i do!
##i receive about hundred or more different notifications daily.
##the phone is always in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one... fourth crazy option: you can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification.
##duh, what about showing that notification.
##i was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until i fix the notifications to suit my needs.
##but still, that would leave me with the curved screen;  curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the lcd.
##i find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g.
##samsung's own s8 active, pixel 2 xl with a proper case are easier to handle.
##so, my argument that i should get s9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore.
##in addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed.
##so many broken s8 phones around.
##i hear they've put much better **glass** into s9.
##duh..  and not to forget the screen protector - there are no good glass screen protectors on the market (yet).
##i don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings.
##well, that option doesn't work good.
##i type fast and often use my phone for work email.
##i can't go and repeat every other letter.
##also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen.
##in fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.
##all in all, i am returning this one, and will wait to see what lg g7 will look like.
##otherwise, will wait for pixel 3. until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than s9.
##some notable positive sides: samsung internet browser is just awesome.
##lcd is excellent.
##even better after apple forcefully reduced the lcd brightness on iphone 7-,  to "help" aged batteries.
##don't know about iphone x, should be also close to 700nits like this one.
##starting camera with double click to power button.
##photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone.
##home button is there - just press glass a bit harder.
##speakerphone is much louder than iphone 7.
##--------------------------------------------------------- update on screen wake-up on notification: googled a bit to see what can be done.
##apparently, people mention that samsung differs from ios and stock android in that you should depend on edge light, led light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up.
##so, samsung tried to be more clever than google or apple.
##lets see if they succeeded; i google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues: 1. some people actually  like that there are no screen wakeup on notifications.
##but their screen is waking up !
##s6, s7, s8, s9.
##people suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls.
##2. some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them.
##3. some people argue why would somebody want to be in group 2. duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed.
##3. some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings  - "wake up screen on notifications".
##well, that seems like it, except that i don't have such option.
##4. there are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications.
##while googling, a verizon help page for s9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... outlook is installed.
##aaaargh.
##i need that one for work.
##anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me.
##i am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs.
##started with notifications, but i don't know what else is there...
[t]Beautiful phone!
##my husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous!
##i love the display and the infinity edge.
##for me this is a total upgrade from the s5 i've been using, i'm so glad i waited!
##everything shows up bright and crystal clear.
##even my email looks nicer!
##the emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really.
##at my age i don't think this is something i see myself using too often in chat or messenger.
##it's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes.
##the camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear.
##however i do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manual  to make it easier to figure out.
##it's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference.
##i'm sure it would be easy enough to look on youtube or google,....haha i suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future.
##:p  i'm not too crazy about bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose.
##i also like my camera settings set so you say "smile", "shoot," "cheese", "record video", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for bixby  you can't use the voice command on the camera.
##one feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on.
##or maybe i have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after i've used it more?
##the speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear.
##using speaker phone i actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either.
##not the case here!
##i love this phone!
##it's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great!
##it was also very easy to set up and after i played with it for awhile i found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover.
##having read how similar this phone is to the s8 i can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but i did read before these were released  that they were similar and if i had an s8 i probably would not have bought this model.
##for the most part i still feel this is a great phone.
##i know for a fact i will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it!
##*3/21/18-  added a few sample pictures,  one is a  close up (approx.12" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet.
##no filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing.
##pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone.
##i've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too.
##using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier.
##i'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit!
##the lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling around  in my bag.
##the hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off.
##you can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me.
##this is a fun phone to have.
##battery life for me is great, i keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty.
##i also have the time  out screen set for 5 minutes.
##i just charge my phone once a day and i'm good to go!
##no regrets with this phone.
##i'll update as i go along, good or bad.

##its basically da same as the galaxy s8
[t]the S9 has better security, a slot to expand memory
##ok, i looked at my old s6 and decided it was time for a new phone, the s9 has better security, a slot to expand memory, newer camera and a bixby assistant if your to lazy to press app.
##what it doesn't have is an ir blaster so i can use it as a remote.
##the upgrades i didn't need are there, the one additional item i liked they removed.
##this is an expensive downgrade for me.
[t]Very nice evolution of the S8
##on the fence here whether i think it should get 4 stars or 5 - probably 4.6 or thereabouts, if we're counting.
##i purchased mine direct from samsung, it arrived on march 14th as promised.
##i'm upgrading from an s8, and have previously owned an s7 and note 5. this is the best of the bunch, for certain, and there is little or no learning curve going from one to the other.
##they took a really good smartphone (s8), and just made it better in many ways (and, in my opinion, worse in a couple, but more on that later).
##dimensions - it's extremely similar to the s8, the only noticeable difference is the overall length is a touch shorter - compensated for by having less black margin around the screen edges.visually, the screen is fantastic.
##the touch responsiveness is fantastic, and the performance is snappy.
##the fingerprint scanner is in a far better position than on the s8.
##things i don't like as much - the iris scanning/facial recognition.
##i preferred the system in the s8 for sure.
##the avatars of yourself you can make from a selfie are, well, just downright creepy.
[t]Switched from iPhone
##i switched to the s9 after i saw the price of the iphonex.
##i am not disappointed with switching to samsung, this phone has a much better display and camera than the iphones do.
##the pictures in the dark are phenomenal.
##it was easy to transfer all the data from my iphone because of the easy set up features.
##if your thinking about switching from the iphone, do it, you will not be disappointed.

##it's  disappointing that this "superior camera phone"  comes without the video editing app like all the previous flagship models.

##i tried other apps and didn't like those.
##now i have to move the video files to my old phone and edit them there.

[t]Embarrassing effort from Samsung
##they had a chance to fix all the laggy, unusable features.
##another forced bixby (it insists upon itself).
##i have both this and the iphone x. surprise, guess which one just works out of the box (spoiler alert: iphone).
##i was so excited about this phone, but it has maybe a (marginally) better camera setup than the s8+.
##its at least as laggy as the last phone.
##its not worth the price, flagship or not.
##if youre os agnostic, get an iphone.
##this is way more trouble than its worth.
##it arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.
##also, in typical android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on.
##every app you install makes the phone that much slower.
##this is an android problem, same thing happens on the pixel 2 xl.
##i should have stuck with the pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.
##it has a nice screen though, but i like the iphones screen as much.
##this is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from samsung.
##maybe itll catch fire like the note and ill be able to be rid of this phone.
[t]Iphone x Has Nothing on This
##i had an iphone x but i sold it for this.
##the iphone x was a huge disappointment.
##i used to buy nothing but apple products, but i realized how far behind apple is.
##this phone has a much larger display and higher quality than the x. plus there is no annoying top notch at the top.
##the camera is better, i took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away.
##the iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible.
##this phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light.
##i don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly.
##overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market.
##the specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues.
##the battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as i would like but it's not terrible either.
##i use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time.
##coming from an iphone user this is much better!

##for this price, i did not want a reburbished phone.
##not only thiat, but the mms messages do not come through and i can't for the life of me,  find out how to write a message...i'm sure that's something i've overlooked though...all in all, i loved my galaxy s5.
##if i could find a way of charging the battery, i'd continue using it, but the prongs are all screwed up...don't get me wrong, i guess this is a beautiful phone and all for techies, but it doesn't do what my old phone did.
##i wish i could find a new galaxy s5.
##but i'm sure they're all refurbished too.
##i'm just really disappointed.
##a lot of the features just don'[t work on my phone...not worth almost a 1000. going to return.
[t]Reported problems - Do Not Buy
##i've had this phone for 16 days and it's now dead.
##when it worked, it was slower than my iphone 6 plus.
##had trouble with texting that i thought was due to software lag.
##seems others are facing similar problems and it's likely a touchscreen problem (dead zones).
##samsung already issued a statement that it's working on the issue.
##my phone is also completely frozen.
##even if i reboot, it freezes at the samsung screen.
##i asked samsung to send me a replacement but they refused and referred me to repair facility.
##it's currently at the repair shop for the 2nd day.
##very expensive inconvenience.
##avoid this handset.
[t]beautiful pictures. Occasionally I trigger the edges when I ...
##fast, packed with customization, beautiful pictures.
##occasionally i trigger the edges when i use it in landscape mode but that's not too big of a deal.
##i wish it was less of a headache to disable bixby.
##even though i have an app that controls bixby, i still see bixby being triggered slightly before the new intended shortcut is triggered.
##if you're going to use a work profile on here, be warned that depending on your place of work you will not be able to use custom keyboards (understandably so).
##it's just a bit confusing when my s7 allowed the use of custom keyboards and the s9+ will not (both phones were used for the same job, don't know why the standards are different).
##great phone, i'm glad i bought it and am having a better experience with it than the phones i've owned previously (galaxy note 4, galaxy s7, nexus 7, pixel xl, moto x).

[t]Easy switch from iPhone!!!
##while i have had several samsung devices in the past - i spent the last few years with several different iphone options.
##in addition to the step price and ear buds priced separately, i am much more of a fan of amazon apps / products and my feeling was these would adapt better to android products.
##i am so thrilled i took the leap to make this change - and here is a list why:  1.  super high quality phone - with simple set up.
##2.  amazing camera with loads of different features.
##3.  dual sim - so enjoy both work and personal number on the same device.
##4.  dual whatsapp!!!
##5.  seamless integration for all amazon apps (photos, shopping, music, kindle, and audible).
##same was not true ot iphone products.
##6.  i have been duped by apple to some degree - h have invested thousands in tv and movies through itunes - hoping that one day they make these available on other devices, but happy that purchases through google or amazon will be should i move back to apple in the future.
##7.  can't beat the price - was able to trade in an old phone and saved $200!!
##it is hard to say what the future holds but i am quite happy to be back with samsung for now!

[t]Top cellphone in the marketplace
##after doing research on pros/cons of top 4 popular smartphones in the marketplace (including iphone x, sony xz2, huawei mate 10 pro, and s9+), i finally made the purchase decision and ordered s9+.
##i am satisfied with the phone.
##it provides several super powerful features to improve experience of daily usage.
##only one improvement which samsung could make is to seal product boxes to protect customer's experience of unboxing.

##wonderful, elegant, fast, the colors in the screen are amazing
[t]Superb!
##i've been a fan of the galaxy series, both tablets and phones, having extensive experience with the s5, s6, s8 and now the s9+.
##the s9+ has dual rear-facing cameras, a first in the series.
##this feature alone was worth upgrading as i'm an avid amateur photographer with several nice dslr cameras, but face it, i take far more photos with my phone simply because it's always with me.
##transitioning from the s8 to s9+ took an hour but was smooth as silk.
##*everything* transferred automatically - apps, pics, files, settings - including the kitchen sink.
##lol  i highly recommend - 5 golden stars!
[t]Five Stars
##awesome phone
[t]Flawed software - Wait for an update ... !
##after years of not using samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, i finally gave it a shot with the s9 plus.
##unfortunately, i had to return the device next day.
##the good:  samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique.
##i especially fell in love with the dex feature.
##being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing.
##i first got introduced to this kind of feature on a huawei mate 10 pro (which i also had to return for other reasons).
##once i actually got exposed to the dex, i knew i wanted it in my life.
##samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled!
##i doubt i have to say more.
##:)  the camera was ok. for some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion.
##compared to my pixel 2 xl pictures, the ones taken with the samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details.
##in this days and age, that's nitpicking, i know.
##all top tier phones take great pictures.
##it doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department.
##the "doesn't matter much but still annoying":  samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot.
##i still don't really care for it but i could at least have lived with it.
##i hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them.
##for instance wifi calling.
##why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under network and connectivity?
##pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back.
##granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the os?
##i know i can disable an app, however, i would prefer if it isn't there in the first place!
##samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive.
##why do i need a samsung clock app that doesn't do any more than the default android clock app?
##why do i need a samsung phone app where the default android phone app is just fine?
##same goes for samsung mail, samsung calendar and a bunch more.
##if i could at least remove them and replace them with the stock android apps, i would be more inclined to buy a samsung phone.
##bixby is a whole other story!
##from the get-go, i had no intention of using samsung's assistant.
##yet, here she was, right in my face.
##i could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely.
##i remembered that the bixby button (which i hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated.
##yeah, sure!
##you first have to create a samsung account, then configure bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in bixby and deactivate the hardware button.
##i don't know who thought of this nonsense!
##as mentioned, i would have been able to live with the above.
##annoying (to me), yes, but i could live with it.
##the bad:  the most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception!
##i got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. i constantly lost network.
##researching this problem online, i learnt that this has been an issue with all of samsung's high end devices since the oreo update.
##the forums across the globe are filled with user complaints.
##the german samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the s8, s8+, note 8, s9 and s9+.
##this has been going on since february, it seems.
##users state that their phones were fine with android 7.x but since the oreo update, everything is a mess.
##strangely, this also affects wifi calling, too.
##i wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls.
##there are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work.
##samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem.
##instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device.
##if that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me!
##in between, samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem.
##regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, i returned mine.

##i love my new phone.
##it is the right size and easy to handle for my smaller hands.
##i enjoy using the "swipe" feature on this phone as it can be done with one hand.
##the phone is very responsive.
##i haven't had it long enough to learn all the features, but so far, it has worked wonderfully and met my expectations.
[t]... upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week
##recently upgraded from the s7 to the s9+ and i'm terribly disappointed.
##last week, i decided to upgrade from a samsung s7 to a samsung s9+.
##i even went all in with the bogo deal from verizon and upgraded junior at the same time.
##rarely have i been so disappointed in a tech purchase!
##and samsung, i hope you have people watching for this sort of post.
##i'll be returning.
##this.
##phone.
##tomorrow.
##major shortcomings include "bixby," microphone placement, and voice recognition.
##first, the "bixby" personal assistant is a train wreck.
##i don't know who decided that an unholy union of the yahoo!
##home page and google assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark.
##and it can't.
##be.
##disabled.
##nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.
##second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless.
##seriously, samsung?!
##the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.
##thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal.
##these features worked nearly flawlessly on my s7, but on the s9+ i'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone "hears" when i talk to it.
##i have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good.
##even if i shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, i can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words.
##i spend 50-60 hours per week driving and must be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible.
##swing and a resounding miss, samsung.

[t]Bad Battery Life
##just wanted to comment that the battery life is terrible.
##samsung has had several years to correct the battery issue and has yet to do so.
[t]CAMERA is Straight FIRREEE(bomb)
##bomb.com  i upgraded from an s7 to the 9+ and i love it, its so many things you can do on this phone and i still don't know everything but for the most part i don't regret spending all this money on a phone and wait let me tell you this camera on this phone is straight fireeee, its so clear and i'm making my youtube videos with this as well.
##samsung you did this
[t]The operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my Panasonic Lumix
##this is my third samsung galaxy after switching from the original iphone.
##this was a huge upgrade from my galaxy alpha.
##the operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my panasonic lumix.
##my wife's galaxy s8 seems just about the same but the 9 is noticeably zippier but i have way fewer apps.
##in our household we have macs, pc's, ipads, roku's, tablets so we aren't married to any particular brand.
##for the phones i've enjoyed samsungs.
##my wife got a deal on an lg and it was a big headache as it had hardware failures.
##important, currently, as of this writing the s9 has a software problem where notifications on the apps does not work.
##since i've come to rely on those little numbers on the top left corner of my apps this is an inconvenience.
##my old samsung came with svoice which i prefer over bixby for simplicity but it's slowly winning me over.
##ask bixby to rap for you, it's hilarious.
[t]Five Stars
##i would like to try the product for free because i always wanna one.
[t]Four Stars
##everything about samsung galaxy s9 is awesome except my volume controls were not functioning sorry 4 stars
[t]Cost vs Performance a Plus
##probably the best phone i've purchased in a long time.
##would definitely recommend to someone looking for an upgrade, especially if they don't want to pay more for similar performance on something like, say, the iphone x. i almost bought an iphone, and after looking at them both i decided to go with the s9 and i am glad i did.
##the display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory.
##the speed of the phone is high, even if you have a lot of apps open, probably due to the 4 gb ram.
##superb performance overall.
##impressed me for sure.
[t]Beautiful Phone!
##i upgraded from a s6 edge+, and i'm a samsung girl for life.
##this phone ran beautifully right from the get-go.
##it's not too bulky, i have no problems using it with one hand.
##the camera is awesome.
##i've been playing with it since i got it out of the box!
##i'm still getting used to the new operating system and layout.
##i've been used to the galaxy's home button, and the back and multi-screen buttons, so it's interesting adapting to a completely smooth device.
##where the apps icon was on the home screen, is now the camera icon.
##if you're upgrading like i did, you have to flick upwards to get to the apps.
##but this is not, in any way, a downside.
##the speakers are great, and listening to music through earphones is awesome.
##i absolutely love this new phone!
##i definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone!
[t]Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far
##i am a die hard apple person.
##all my desktop computers at home are apple, my other 4 family members all have iphones and we have laptops that are all apple.
##not really sure why i decided to try out the samsung galaxy s9+ but happy that i did so far.
##i was using a 4 1/2 year old iphone 5s so i figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world.
##it still takes a little getting used to coming from the ios system's way of doing things.
##i do lose the capability of imessage and facetime.
##not a huge deal and i can use the duo app from google which is the same as facetime.
##the key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great.
##i like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration).
##i think the new iphone x does this too but again, i'm coming from a 5s.
##my only two choices for a new phone were this s9+ or keep on with apple and get an iphone x. the x would have cost me $1150 plus an applecare warranty for $200.
##i got this samsung (and got the ultimate play bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle.
##took out a square trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should i need to use it.
##i have used square trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee.
##square trade is owned by allstate so i have confidence in them.
##getting back to the phone, the s9+ seems to work very fast when loading apps and pages.
##i use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (nest thermostat, wireless cameras, lifx lights, liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly.
##the audio when playing music sounds great.
##plays very loud and clear for a phone.
##i like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack.
##i like the android system as it comes with google assistant voice command.
##most people hate the bixby feature on this phone.
##my only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume i accidentally hit bixby sometimes.
##i do like though that i's voice activated.
##i get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up bixby and command it to open up whatever app i need (usually waze).
##once open, i speak to waze to take me to work.
##all of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road.
##also, the bixby ai camera function is very cool too.
##there are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera.
##like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to english or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone).
##point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count.
##point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...).
##the only thing i think i will never use again and of course i tried it out is the animoji of myself or any of my friends.
##it's scary weird.
##everyone looks the same on this.
##i would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3d type and look more realistic.
##i have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others.
##mot notably the iphone x. in my opinion, the x does do a lot of pix better.
##the contrast is usually better.
##the real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit.
##so, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iphone x. the only thing i had to get used to is the colors on a samsung phone are very oversaturated.
##colors are very bright.
##there is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view.
##i turned it down to one of them and it now looks a lot more realistic.
##i like the fact that this phone, as well as the iphone x, features ability to record video at 4k 60fps.
##looks great.
##on the samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4k 60fps.
##keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue.
##for all other video formats, the stabilization on the samsung works better than the x. all in all, i am happy i went with the samsung.
##in a few months if i regret it, i can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iphone x plus.
##update: 4/7/2018.
##the voice unlock code is terrible.
##and, after searching through the options on the phone i came to the conclusion i don't need it.
##i have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back.
##i actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use.
##battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now.
##one thing i find annoying that i didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting.
##whether i send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all.
##this is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space.
##i was used to having an iphone and using imessage.
##send any size video to someone else with an iphone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text.
##not so with android.
##now this is not just samsung but all android phones.
##so, for now, i have to send videos via whatsapp or viber (or a number of other text apps).
##they do compress but not horribly.
##oh, and one more note.
##i hope samsung corp is reading this review.
##the samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people i have ever dealt with for a tech company.
##i used to think comcast was bad until i called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at samsung.
##they just repeat my question and tell me they understand how i feel offering absolutely no answers.
##they put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve.
##just terrible customer service.
##180 degrees from dealing with someone at applecare when i had a question about my iphone or imac computer.
##2nd update: i didn't  realize this and this is very important to know before purchasing.
##in fact, i'm on the at&t network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this.
##the sales people in best buy in the phone department did not know this either.
##when you buy an unlocked galaxy s9 or s9+, your phone is $840.
##if however you want to buy it thru at&t for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it.
##meaning, the unlocked phone will not have: wifi calling option, hd audio option, vvm (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling.
##the option for these features is not even on my phone.
##now, you can buy the at&t phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone).
##after you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the at&t phone unlocked and then you will have these features.
##nowhere at best buy or any at&t store do they tell you this.
##in my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing.
##i picked up the bundle package here on amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so i'm keeping my setup.
##i just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get.
##i figured the at&t version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed.
##hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features.
##and, i went to the at&t store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone.
##there isn't.
##they cannot update your phone to get these options.
##3rd update: april 15th, 2018 i discovered a great feature today.
##i wish these galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iphone x has.
##you pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go.
##what i discovered is setting the google assistant to open the galaxy even from the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the google assistant to do.
##love this feature immensely.
##4th update april 23, 2018 as i play around more with this phone, i am learning some cool things it can do.
##for instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray.
##no need for repetition with swiping either up or down.
##there is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you.
##even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier).
##also, one thing samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate.
##now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control media volume no matter what you are viewing.
##and, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the media volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them.
##apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the galaxy phones that is now solved.

[t]Slick Performance & Exterior
##i'm upgrading from a bricked nexus 5x so the performance and feel of this phone is leaps and bounds beyond what i'm used to.
##i've been using google phones for a number of years so i was concerned about samsung wrecking the ui.
##but after disabling bixby and its button, it's pretty much back to working like vanilla android as far as i'm concerned.
##i like the "infinity screen" for the fact that it increases screen size without greatly increasing the size of the phone.
##my 5x is only a bit smaller than the s9+!
##my biggest complaint, and the reason i'm giving 4/5 stars is for the exterior feel of this phone - it's very very slippery!
##the 5x has a rubberized coating that makes it easy to pick up and hold and also not slide off of surfaces, i greatly miss that.
##for example when i navigate while driving i put the phone on my right knee.
##this new phone immediately slides right off.

##i installed it from another source, called up carrier with sim imei and iccid and 2 min later visual voicemail was working great.
##i might buy another one for myself.
[t]Worth every cent!
##i absolutely love my new phone.
##samsung hit it out of the park with the s9+.
##it has every feature, detail, options, and specifics that you could possibly want.
##when considering whether to purchase this phone, i researched all of the other top rated phones.
##i truly feel this is the best phone available at this time.
##yes, the downfall may be the price.
##but, i truly believe in the saying, "you get what you pay for."
##the price i paid through amazon was at least $50-100 us dollars cheaper than anywhere else.
##the wrap around full-screen is phenomenal.
##the camera capability is so good that i don't need to take a separate camera with me any longer.
##if you have the money, get it!!

[t]I'm in first-world heaven...
##i'm upgrading from am s5 and am totally enamored with this phone.
##transferring files from my old device was a breeze.
##battery life is amazing, comparatively speaking, and i'm loving the customization abilities.
##i've had galaxies since the original s and stroll feel these are the best phones on the market.
##the camera is astounding.
##very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend this version.

[t]Defective phone
##i had the s8 and screens were slipping and sliding/opening and closing.
##that was resolved either with an update or one of many calls to verizon (don't recall.)
##also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning.
##my boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and i could hear much better.
##but i had already ordered the s9 since i didn't think we could fix the audio on the s8.
##i'm having so many issues with it.
##i was on the phone with verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs.
##after exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that i got a defective phone!
##what are the odds?
##when i try to google, email or text, i get knocked out into home screen.
##very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text.
##perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive.
##it's not the apps - we put it in safe mode.
##we changed everything around including samsung keyboard to gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't.
##i'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review.
##aren't i the lucky one?
##i think i'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone.
##new phone arriving tomorrow and will go to verizon store for set up as i did with this phone.
##wish me luck please!
##thanks.

[t]Samsung unveiled its Beast S9 plus for 2018
##i have upgraded from s8 plus and i really see an improvement in the performance , especially camera, ar emoji and face detection features are awesome.
[t]Good phone
##had problems activating it through verizon but finally got it.
##great camera.
##pretty much the same as a  s8 with a few cool upgrades.
[t]Phone worth purchasing upgraded from the s5 model
##i upgraded from the s5, and i can tell you that the phone is the best phone on the market currently.
##i've been a loyal samsung customer for years, and when i hold a phone for long term use i really keep it until something is worth purchasing.
##where the iphone lacks the s9 plus makes up for.
##the ram, expandable storage option of 400 gb's, and beautiful display, & somewhat ok price(the more advance the more expensive technology will be) places the phone already ahead of many phone companies.
##samsung truly improved upon the phone, and i can say i'm satisfied.
[t]Better than expected!
##coming over from a nexus 6p and i'm starting to realize how outdated my phone really was.
##the screen on this phone is amazing.
##camera is awesome, and the headphones that come with the box are surprisingly decent.
##the phone and its settings are very customizable and that's something i really love.
##the resolution on the phone is absolutely beautiful.
##one of the best displays that i've ever seen.
##battery life is pretty good so far as well.
##going to continue playing playing around with the phone and provide updates to whatever happens either positive or negative with my phone.
##but so far it's great!

[t]Compared to my last phone it's a dream come true
##like the title says... i was using an iphone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago.
##i'll break down what i like and do not like about this phone though: pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps i use as well as the internet.
##if has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it.
##(honestly i highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.)
##the sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what i had before.
##cons: the phone is much heavier than what i am used to or what i had expected.
##the camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iphone) when you zoom in.
##the price for the phone was about average.
##i found this to be a better deal than the google xl 2, or the iphone x which in my opinion were both overpriced, however i still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies.
##lastly, if you are an ios user and are considering switching to android like i did, heed my warning, because i can't put this in larger letters if i tried: do not forget to deactivate your imessages.
##if you do not deactivate them, you will not be able to receive imessages (texts) from any iphone or ipad user.
##i ran into a huge issue with this and even though i was incredibly careful, i still had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue.
##all in all, i am very happy with my purchase.
##p.s.
##: note that if you are changing from ios to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing.
##i had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. android using google and facebook.
##i highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.
[t]Oof
##love it so far, earphones are the biggest downside to it, that look pathetically made and sound bad but overall the phone itself is a beauty

[t]The touch sensor is lightning fast compared to the s7 and the iris/face scanner is bad either. The one biggest complaint I have is ...
##i upgraded from my galaxy s7 and the s9 is a very refreshing experience so far.
##very fast and responsive.
##i was hesitant at first because it doesn't have a home button but i have completely forgot about it already.
##the touch sensor is lightning fast compared to the s7 and the iris/face scanner is bad either.
##the one biggest complaint i have is the bixby button which they don't let you remap.
[t]Love it!
##upgraded from the s6.
##love it!
##fingerprint on back is cool and hidden home button is good too.
##activated verizon set up all online super easy.
##i bought a caseology case and screen protector.
##needed to change the touch screen sensitivity to make it normal (for a while it was difficult to type).
[t]I hate this phone
##i just got this phone through my work.
##i've owned the galaxy 4,5, and 7, so i figured i'd stay with the same brand and get the s9.
##i've had it only a few days, and the screen is so unresponsive when clicking and scrolling and apps are spontaneously shutting down.
##i do love the creativity behind this and camera features, but getting the darn thing to work is quite frustrating.
[t]Completely broken notifications. Curved glass is a disaster. Excellent display.
##i am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.
##i use lg, pixel and iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon samsung long time ago.
##every cheap lg just worked better than samsung for me.
##decided to try s9  due it's small size; the only other option was google pixel but its display is just too bad.
##the only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display.
##heck, except in youtube, the buttons are always  there, making that 5" screen more like 4.5", in a body that's wider than s9.
##what a nonsense..  anyway, s9 notifications:  no notifications on locked screen:  i have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then i'll see notifications.
##iphone/pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, i can see if it's anything interesting, if not i go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.
##limited notifications on locked screen: shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone.
##some settings available that don't help much.
##androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications.
##if you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.
##raise to wakeup and show notifications: with iphone/pixel/nexus, i would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing  notifications.
##as soon as i put the phone down the screen goes off.
##when i pickup s9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...  notifications while using the phone: some message comes in, the phone does nothing.
##sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup.
##all this regardless of notification sounds settings and silent mode.
##wtf ?
##app icon number: not reliably cleared or set on google inbox, outlook, google play, to name a few.
##note: some of these problems are tied to notification sound being off.
##so, they tied together sound and visual part of the notification system.
##maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between visual and sound notifications in  settings.
##naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.
##samsung knows that but they failed to get it right.
##it's understandable why they failed - read below about the sw update i got.
##anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g.
##after i change different options) but then get broken again.
##classical samsung...  all in all, i am relying on my pebble to show me notifications.
##some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent.
##so why samsung doesn't care ?
##well, just two days into preorder (i already got my phone) and i get software update with important bug fixes.
##so, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs.
##they start lots of things, and  rarely nail a single one.
##first crazy option: edge screen notifications.
##you got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what.
##second crazy  option: turn on screensaver when screen is off.
##it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ?
##wtf ?
##third crazy option: always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that i have notifications... sure i do!
##i receive about hundred or more different notifications daily.
##the phone is always in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one... fourth crazy option: you can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification.
##duh, what about showing that notification.
##i was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until i fix the notifications to suit my needs.
##but still, that would leave me with the curved screen;  curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the lcd.
##i find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g.
##samsung's own s8 active, pixel 2 xl with a proper case are easier to handle.
##so, my argument that i should get s9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore.
##in addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed.
##so many broken s8 phones around.
##i hear they've put much better **glass** into s9.
##duh..  and not to forget the screen protector - there are no good glass screen protectors on the market (yet).
##i don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings.
##well, that option doesn't work good.
##i type fast and often use my phone for work email.
##i can't go and repeat every other letter.
##also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen.
##in fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.
##all in all, i am returning this one, and will wait to see what lg g7 will look like.
##otherwise, will wait for pixel 3. until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than s9.
##some notable positive sides: samsung internet browser is just awesome.
##lcd is excellent.
##even better after apple forcefully reduced the lcd brightness on iphone 7-,  to "help" aged batteries.
##don't know about iphone x, should be also close to 700nits like this one.
##starting camera with double click to power button.
##photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone.
##home button is there - just press glass a bit harder.
##speakerphone is much louder than iphone 7.
##--------------------------------------------------------- update on screen wake-up on notification: googled a bit to see what can be done.
##apparently, people mention that samsung differs from ios and stock android in that you should depend on edge light, led light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up.
##so, samsung tried to be more clever than google or apple.
##lets see if they succeeded; i google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues: 1. some people actually  like that there are no screen wakeup on notifications.
##but their screen is waking up !
##s6, s7, s8, s9.
##people suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls.
##2. some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them.
##3. some people argue why would somebody want to be in group 2. duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed.
##3. some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings  - "wake up screen on notifications".
##well, that seems like it, except that i don't have such option.
##4. there are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications.
##while googling, a verizon help page for s9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... outlook is installed.
##aaaargh.
##i need that one for work.
##anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me.
##i am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs.
##started with notifications, but i don't know what else is there...
[t]One Star
##its basically da same as the galaxy s8
[t]the S9 has better security, a slot to expand memory
##ok, i looked at my old s6 and decided it was time for a new phone, the s9 has better security, a slot to expand memory, newer camera and a bixby assistant if your to lazy to press app.
##what it doesn't have is an ir blaster so i can use it as a remote.
##the upgrades i didn't need are there, the one additional item i liked they removed.
##this is an expensive downgrade for me.
[t]Very nice evolution of the S8
##on the fence here whether i think it should get 4 stars or 5 - probably 4.6 or thereabouts, if we're counting.
##i purchased mine direct from samsung, it arrived on march 14th as promised.
##i'm upgrading from an s8, and have previously owned an s7 and note 5. this is the best of the bunch, for certain, and there is little or no learning curve going from one to the other.
##they took a really good smartphone (s8), and just made it better in many ways (and, in my opinion, worse in a couple, but more on that later).
##dimensions - it's extremely similar to the s8, the only noticeable difference is the overall length is a touch shorter - compensated for by having less black margin around the screen edges.visually, the screen is fantastic.
##the touch responsiveness is fantastic, and the performance is snappy.
##the fingerprint scanner is in a far better position than on the s8.
##things i don't like as much - the iris scanning/facial recognition.
##i preferred the system in the s8 for sure.
##the avatars of yourself you can make from a selfie are, well, just downright creepy.
[t]Switched from iPhone
##i switched to the s9 after i saw the price of the iphonex.
##i am not disappointed with switching to samsung, this phone has a much better display and camera than the iphones do.
##the pictures in the dark are phenomenal.
##it was easy to transfer all the data from my iphone because of the easy set up features.
##if your thinking about switching from the iphone, do it, you will not be disappointed.
[t]1. Bixby must DIE. Can't kill it. ...
##1. bixby must die.

[t]Much to lean from a long time iPhone user
##the screen is beautiful.
##the ability to customize is overwhelming.
##the always on clock is a great idea.
##the camera takes great pictures, but since the screen is to the edge, i am always accidentally enabling something while holding it.
##its harder just to make a quick phone call than the iphone is (need more customizing i guess).
##the slide down feature on the lock screen has many options, but no clock or calculator like the iphone does (without add-on modifying).
##the standard ring tones are very limited and not desirable.
##even though the music plays loud, the ringtones do not.
##even though it has a press button lock, then swipe, it still seems to unlock in my pocket.
##but the iphone did too.
##the bixby turns on when i dont want it to, and doesn't when i do.
##very frustrating.
##the usb c connector is nice.
##there are 1000 things this phone can do that i have not discovered yet.
[t]Cannot activate on Verizon - not a recognized device
##i received the product just fine, but verizon was unable to activate it, since it didn't even recognize the device.
##since the device was not shipped with a sim card, which is not mentioned on the webpage, the employee at the verizon store used a standard verizon sim card to try and activate it.
##all in all, a big waste of my lunch hour!!
##it is already being shipped back...

[t]It has lots of internal memory. The phone it self works very fast. Buy a screen protector ASAP !
##i recently purchased a s9 plus from verizon.
##so far it seems to work better than my s5,but the glass screen seems to scratch very easily.
##i have been very careful but scratches keep appearing , almost over night.
##i'm beginning to wonder.
##i'm not happy about the durability of the glass screen.
[t]Would recommend getting the S9.... S9 Plus if you're a camera buff
##literally the best phone i've ever had, i loved it so much i decided to upgrade to the s9 plus version.
##here's my layman's review on both.
##pros: - the night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting.
##- battery life is massive with both phone: s9 has a 3000mah / s9 plus 3500mah - plenty of ram: s9 has 4gigs/ s9 plus 6gigs.
##both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of ram seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the s9 suffice with little to no slowdowns.
##-  headphone jack on both version.
##also comes with some sweet akg earbuds.
##- ar emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone - thin phone - 4k video quality - great speakers - samsung pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (not like google pay that relies on the ereader).
##- live translations with bixby vision - (plus version)  live photo mode.
##really great feature, and editable -  (plus version) 2 rear cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual capture  cons: - while night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated.
##- there isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones.
##- what is the point of bixby?
##really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking "i should give bixby a try" - while thin, it's somewhat heavy.
##- besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between s9 and s9 plus.
##verdict: as stated above, i love the s9 so much i upgraded to the plus version.
##both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down.
##photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions.
##my only issue is the new bixby button: it's not something i would actively use but at least users can disable this feature.
##overall it's a lovely phone, s9 works just as well as the s9 plus but lacking a few features with the camera.
[t]Don't buy if you have a Blue Tiger headset drivers
##has a bluetooth connection issue with blue tiger headsets that samsung is aware of but has yet to correct
[t]Well iPhone was better than Samsung after changing management they lost their quality
##i was using samsung so long ago then switch to iphone.
##well iphone was better than samsung after changing management they lost their quality.

##awesome camera and i'm still learning some of the features coming from a motorola.
[t]Returned after a week because of Macbook Integration
##i decided to move to android after 5+ years with apple.
##main reason i bought the s9+ was the camera.
##you can get along with the android way of doing things, but what really pissed me of was when i tried to backup the photos i took in my macbook.
##actually i have *returned* this phone after struggling an entire day searching an easy way to backup pictures on my mac.
##after trying 5 different apps (including some weirdo chinese apps), trying with an sd card and everything, it was clear to me that this phone integration with a macbook was a big no for me.
##oh, did i mention that some of the files got corrupted when i moved from internal storage to micro sd?

[t]Great battery life, camera. Excellent ergonomic design.
##best android smartphone.
[t]Android Oreo unstable
##s9 could be a wonderful phone but the os sucks at this point.
##phone os traps you in delete mode for both messages and email, only way out is shutting the phone down and repowering up, at least once a day.
##additionally phone comes bloated with google everything with permissions for way too much.
##settings are multi layered and manual is useless, eventually you can modify settings to meet your needs, if you do not it is setup to eat battery power, and data at amazingly high rates.
##if they can get the delete traps fixed then the phone would be acceptable or maybe amazing, cant see that yet.
##maybe after they do some more fixes.
##i have had two system upgrades so far..... hoping for some sanity and stability soon..... please

##recommended that you still use a pin number or the finger scanner to unlock your phone and security pay type apps.
##the iris scanner has difficulties if you wear glasses!
##the facial recognition software works about 50 to 75 percent of the time

##arrived earlier than expected, everything was included in the box, works 100%.
[t]Disappointing
##i got my phone from best buy to replace the s8+.
##it's  disappointing that this "superior camera phone"  comes without the video editing app like all the previous flagship models.
##they call that app "movie maker" the app is made by samsung electronics and is not available  on android market.
##i tried other apps and didn't like those.
##now i have to move the video files to my old phone and edit them there.
##thanks, samsung for discontinuing what i need and adding what i don't,  like stupid bixby.
##should i go to apple store and check  their iphones?
##i tried other

##so far so good.
##never thought i'd leave apple but samsung has a better product.
[t]Embarrassing effort from Samsung
##they had a chance to fix all the laggy, unusable features.
##another forced bixby (it insists upon itself).
##i have both this and the iphone x. surprise, guess which one just works out of the box (spoiler alert: iphone).
##i was so excited about this phone, but it has maybe a (marginally) better camera setup than the s8+.
##its at least as laggy as the last phone.
##its not worth the price, flagship or not.
##if youre os agnostic, get an iphone.
##this is way more trouble than its worth.
##it arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.
##also, in typical android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on.
##every app you install makes the phone that much slower.
##this is an android problem, same thing happens on the pixel 2 xl.
##i should have stuck with the pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.
##it has a nice screen though, but i like the iphones screen as much.
##this is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from samsung.
##maybe itll catch fire like the note and ill be able to be rid of this phone.
[t]Iphone x Has Nothing on This
##i had an iphone x but i sold it for this.
##the iphone x was a huge disappointment.
##i used to buy nothing but apple products, but i realized how far behind apple is.
##this phone has a much larger display and higher quality than the x. plus there is no annoying top notch at the top.
##the camera is better, i took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away.
##the iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible.
##this phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light.
##i don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly.
##overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market.
##the specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues.
##the battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as i would like but it's not terrible either.
##i use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time.
##coming from an iphone user this is much better!

[t]Product is NOT new. It comes used and disorganized
##i received it on april 11 2018 and sadly it was used.
##as soon as i opened the box, phone was upside down, box was disorganized and headphones & cables misplaced.
##i needed the phone so much that i stayed with it but if you have another option simply go for another one.
[t]I had a gear S2 because of which I upgraded to S9+ from LG G5

##used xperia z2 and lg g5 each flagships of their times, paid full release amount for both phones.
##best experience so far.
##i used wave ii and samsung corby (was disappointed with both) gave samsung a chance with gear s2, got impressed hence tried s9+ refined software and redifned flaws of innovation in any successfull flagship.
##i didn't have it delivered but it's an awesome device!!

##had it for two weeks and really find it a really fine phone, i only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that i sometimes notice dead spots on the touch screen, and i find myself having tap more in some areas than in others.
##it's not predictable, and seems to come and go , and is definitely not a deal breaker.
##overall, i'm very impressed with this phone, and have no regrets buying it.

##very good phone but i give only 4 stars because there is no ir port.

[t]Easy switch from iPhone!!!
##while i have had several samsung devices in the past - i spent the last few years with several different iphone options.
##in addition to the step price and ear buds priced separately, i am much more of a fan of amazon apps / products and my feeling was these would adapt better to android products.
##i am so thrilled i took the leap to make this change - and here is a list why:  1.  super high quality phone - with simple set up.
##2.  amazing camera with loads of different features.
##3.  dual sim - so enjoy both work and personal number on the same device.
##4.  dual whatsapp!!!
##5.  seamless integration for all amazon apps (photos, shopping, music, kindle, and audible).
##same was not true ot iphone products.
##6.  i have been duped by apple to some degree - h have invested thousands in tv and movies through itunes - hoping that one day they make these available on other devices, but happy that purchases through google or amazon will be should i move back to apple in the future.
##7.  can't beat the price - was able to trade in an old phone and saved $200!!
##it is hard to say what the future holds but i am quite happy to be back with samsung for now!
