phone arrived on time a and in good condition it might be somewhat louder than the 8plus, but not much. the phone itself appears to simply be an s7 with two speakers. the glowing reviews of the camera might be accurate but my purchase wasn't guided by taking selfies. the camera is secondary to me. an overall great phone but doesn't live up to the hype.
after years of not using samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, i finally gave it a shot with the s9 plus. unfortunately, i had to return the device next day.  the good:  samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. i especially fell in love with the dex feature. being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. i first got introduced to this kind of feature on a huawei mate 10 pro (which i also had to return for other reasons). once i actually got exposed to the dex, i knew i wanted it in my life.  samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! i doubt i have to say more. :)  the camera was ok. for some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. compared to my pixel 2 xl pictures, the ones taken with the samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. in this days and age, that's nitpicking, i know. all top tier phones take great pictures. it doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department.  the "doesn't matter much but still annoying":  samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. i still don't really care for it but i could at least have lived with it. i hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. for instance wifi calling. why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under network and connectivity?  pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the os? i know i can disable an app, however, i would prefer if it isn't there in the first place!  samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. why do i need a samsung clock app that doesn't do any more than the default android clock app? why do i need a samsung phone app where the default android phone app is just fine? same goes for samsung mail, samsung calendar and a bunch more. if i could at least remove them and replace them with the stock android apps, i would be more inclined to buy a samsung phone.  bixby is a whole other story! from the get-go, i had no intention of using samsung's assistant. yet, here she was, right in my face. i could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. i remembered that the bixby button (which i hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. yeah, sure! you first have to create a samsung account, then configure bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in bixby and deactivate the hardware button. i don't know who thought of this nonsense!  as mentioned, i would have been able to live with the above. annoying (to me), yes, but i could live with it.  the bad:  the most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! i got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. i constantly lost network. researching this problem online, i learnt that this has been an issue with all of samsung's high end devices since the oreo update. the forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. the german samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the s8, s8+, note 8, s9 and s9+. this has been going on since february, it seems. users state that their phones were fine with android 7.x but since the oreo update, everything is a mess.  strangely, this also affects wifi calling, too. i wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. there are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. if that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! in between, samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem.  regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, i returned mine.
recently upgraded from the s7 to the s9+ and i'm terribly disappointed. last week, i decided to upgrade from a samsung s7 to a samsung s9+. i even went all in with the bogo deal from verizon and upgraded junior at the same time.  rarely have i been so disappointed in a tech purchase! and samsung, i hope you have people watching for this sort of post. i'll be returning. this. phone. tomorrow. major shortcomings include "bixby," microphone placement, and voice recognition.  first, the "bixby" personal assistant is a train wreck. i don't know who decided that an unholy union of the yahoo! home page and google assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. and it can't. be. disabled. nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.  second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. seriously, samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.  thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. these features worked nearly flawlessly on my s7, but on the s9+ i'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone "hears" when i talk to it. i have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. even if i shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, i can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. i spend 50-60 hours per week driving and must be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible.  swing and a resounding miss, samsung.
just wanted to comment that the battery life is terrible. samsung has had several years to correct the battery issue and has yet to do so.
traded in my s7. the old model allowed me to assign different notification sounds for each of my contacts for messaging. this allowed me to tell who was texting without looking at my phone. the new one lacks that ability. even when i can convince samsung support that alaska is not a foreign nation they dont seem to be able to tell me if the problem is intentional or fixable in the future. i smell apples in my future.
the galaxy s9 is an amazing phone.... but.... the unlocked version on amazon is not compatible with verizon. i took it to three different stores to make sure it was the phone and not verizon.
i recieved the wrong color. :(
i had the s8 and screens were slipping and sliding/opening and closing.  that was resolved either with an update or one of many calls to verizon (don't recall.) also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning.  my boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and i could hear much better. but i had already ordered the s9 since i didn't think we could fix the audio on the s8.  i'm having so many issues with it.  i was on the phone with verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs. after exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that i got a defective phone!  what are the odds?  when i try to google, email or text, i get knocked out into home screen.  very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text.  perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive. it's not the apps - we put it in safe mode.  we changed everything around including samsung keyboard to gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't. i'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review.  aren't i the lucky one?  i think i'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone.  new phone arriving tomorrow and will go to verizon store for set up as i did with this phone.  wish me luck please!  thanks.
i just got this phone through my work. i've owned the galaxy 4,5, and 7, so i figured i'd stay with the same brand and get the s9. i've had it only a few days, and the screen is so unresponsive when clicking and scrolling and apps are spontaneously shutting down.  i do love the creativity behind this and camera features, but getting the darn thing to work is quite frustrating.
i am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications. i use lg, pixel and iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon samsung long time ago. every cheap lg just worked better than samsung for me. decided to try s9  due it's small size; the only other option was google pixel but its display is just too bad. the only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. heck, except in youtube, the buttons are always  there, making that 5" screen more like 4.5", in a body that's wider than s9. what a nonsense..  anyway, s9 notifications:  no notifications on locked screen:  i have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then i'll see notifications. iphone/pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, i can see if it's anything interesting, if not i go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.  limited notifications on locked screen: shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. some settings available that don't help much. androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. if you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.  raise to wakeup and show notifications: with iphone/pixel/nexus, i would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing  notifications. as soon as i put the phone down the screen goes off. when i pickup s9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...  notifications while using the phone: some message comes in, the phone does nothing. sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup. all this regardless of notification sounds settings and silent mode. wtf ?  app icon number: not reliably cleared or set on google inbox, outlook, google play, to name a few.  note: some of these problems are tied to notification sound being off. so, they tied together sound and visual part of the notification system. maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between visual and sound notifications in  settings. naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.  samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. it's understandable why they failed - read below about the sw update i got.  anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after i change different options) but then get broken again. classical samsung...  all in all, i am relying on my pebble to show me notifications.  some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. so why samsung doesn't care ?  well, just two days into preorder (i already got my phone) and i get software update with important bug fixes. so, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. they start lots of things, and  rarely nail a single one.  first crazy option: edge screen notifications. you got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what. second crazy  option: turn on screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? wtf ? third crazy option: always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that i have notifications... sure i do! i receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. the phone is always in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one... fourth crazy option: you can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. duh, what about showing that notification.  i was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until i fix the notifications to suit my needs. but still, that would leave me with the curved screen;  curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the lcd. i find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. samsung's own s8 active, pixel 2 xl with a proper case are easier to handle. so, my argument that i should get s9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore. in addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. so many broken s8 phones around. i hear they've put much better **glass** into s9.  duh..  and not to forget the screen protector - there are no good glass screen protectors on the market (yet). i don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. well, that option doesn't work good. i type fast and often use my phone for work email. i can't go and repeat every other letter. also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. in fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.  all in all, i am returning this one, and will wait to see what lg g7 will look like. otherwise, will wait for pixel 3. until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than s9.  some notable positive sides: samsung internet browser is just awesome. lcd is excellent. even better after apple forcefully reduced the lcd brightness on iphone 7-,  to "help" aged batteries. don't know about iphone x, should be also close to 700nits like this one. starting camera with double click to power button. photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone. home button is there - just press glass a bit harder. speakerphone is much louder than iphone 7.  --------------------------------------------------------- update on screen wake-up on notification: googled a bit to see what can be done. apparently, people mention that samsung differs from ios and stock android in that you should depend on edge light, led light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. so, samsung tried to be more clever than google or apple. lets see if they succeeded; i google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues: 1. some people actually  like that there are no screen wakeup on notifications. but their screen is waking up ! s6, s7, s8, s9. people suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls. 2. some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them. 3. some people argue why would somebody want to be in group 2. duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed. 3. some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings  - "wake up screen on notifications". well, that seems like it, except that i don't have such option. 4. there are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. while googling, a verizon help page for s9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... outlook is installed. aaaargh. i need that one for work. anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me. i am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. started with notifications, but i don't know what else is there...
its basically da same as the galaxy s8
ok, i looked at my old s6 and decided it was time for a new phone, the s9 has better security, a slot to expand memory, newer camera and a bixby assistant if your to lazy to press app.  what it doesn't have is an ir blaster so i can use it as a remote. the upgrades i didn't need are there, the one additional item i liked they removed. this is an expensive downgrade for me.
1. bixby must die. can't kill it. can't remap it. forced down your throat. 2. bloatware must die. sammy will never learn. 3. way over priced.  bixby must die.  stick with hardware, leave software to google.
the smartphone is amazing, but the charger died in the second day that i used it.
item lost in mail.
in mobile networks, under apn, it says tracfone reseller!  for this price, i did not want a reburbished phone. not only thiat, but the mms messages do not come through and i can't for the life of me,  find out how to write a message...i'm sure that's something i've overlooked though...all in all, i loved my galaxy s5.  if i could find a way of charging the battery, i'd continue using it, but the prongs are all screwed up...don't get me wrong, i guess this is a beautiful phone and all for techies, but it doesn't do what my old phone did. i wish i could find a new galaxy s5. but i'm sure they're all refurbished too.  i'm just really disappointed. a lot of the features just don'[t work on my phone...not worth almost a 1000. going to return.
i've had this phone for 16 days and it's now dead. when it worked, it was slower than my iphone 6 plus. had trouble with texting that i thought was due to software lag. seems others are facing similar problems and it's likely a touchscreen problem (dead zones). samsung already issued a statement that it's working on the issue. my phone is also completely frozen. even if i reboot, it freezes at the samsung screen. i asked samsung to send me a replacement but they refused and referred me to repair facility.  it's currently at the repair shop for the 2nd day. very expensive inconvenience. avoid this handset.
this phone is a yard sale.  i cannot attach text tones to contacts?  i cannot turn off the camera shutter noise without turning off all system sounds?  i cannot adjust lengths of time text notifications remain on the screen? by the time i have picked up the phone and brought it close enough to read it disappears?  i cannot adjust the timeout length of the lock screen? i go to it to glance at notifications and it turns off.  and this is the ninth version?  what an utterly clunky experience.
i bought this phone in march and it eas delivered on march 20, and today the camera stoped working; dont know what went wrong, but ill send it back its no good.
the battery drains quickly
this phone would have 5 stars if it weren't for oreo killing valuable features. samaung's community has been clamoring for them to bring back individual text notifications and to free up the useless bixby button, but samsung developers won't listen. apparently they know what their customers want better than their customers do...
the screen is beautiful. the ability to customize is overwhelming.  the always on clock is a great idea. the camera takes great pictures, but since the screen is to the edge, i am always accidentally enabling something while holding it. its harder just to make a quick phone call than the iphone is (need more customizing i guess). the slide down feature on the lock screen has many options, but no clock or calculator like the iphone does (without add-on modifying). the standard ring tones are very limited and not desirable. even though the music plays loud, the ringtones do not. even though it has a press button lock, then swipe, it still seems to unlock in my pocket. but the iphone did too. the bixby turns on when i dont want it to, and doesn't when i do. very frustrating. the usb c connector is nice. there are 1000 things this phone can do that i have not discovered yet.
i received the product just fine, but verizon was unable to activate it, since it didn't even recognize the device.  since the device was not shipped with a sim card, which is not mentioned on the webpage, the employee at the verizon store used a standard verizon sim card to try and activate it.  all in all, a big waste of my lunch hour!!  it is already being shipped back...
i recently purchased a s9 plus from verizon. so far it seems to work better than my s5,but the glass screen seems to scratch very easily.  i have been very careful but scratches keep appearing , almost over night. i'm beginning to wonder. i'm not happy about the durability of the glass screen.
has a bluetooth connection issue with blue tiger headsets that samsung is aware of but has yet to correct
i decided to move to android after 5+ years with apple. main reason i bought the s9+ was the camera. you can get along with the android way of doing things, but what really pissed me of was when i tried to backup the photos i took in my macbook.  actually i have *returned* this phone after struggling an entire day searching an easy way to backup pictures on my mac.  after trying 5 different apps (including some weirdo chinese apps), trying with an sd card and everything, it was clear to me that this phone integration with a macbook was a big no for me. oh, did i mention that some of the files got corrupted when i moved from internal storage to micro sd?
s9 could be a wonderful phone but the os sucks at this point. phone os traps you in delete mode for both messages and email, only way out is shutting the phone down and repowering up, at least once a day. additionally phone comes bloated with google everything with permissions for way too much. settings are multi layered and manual is useless, eventually you can modify settings to meet your needs, if you do not it is setup to eat battery power, and data at amazingly high rates. if they can get the delete traps fixed then the phone would be acceptable or maybe amazing, cant see that yet. maybe after they do some more fixes. i have had two system upgrades so far..... hoping for some sanity and stability soon..... please
i got my phone from best buy to replace the s8+. it's  disappointing that this "superior camera phone"  comes without the video editing app like all the previous flagship models. they call that app "movie maker" the app is made by samsung electronics and is not available  on android market.  i tried other apps and didn't like those. now i have to move the video files to my old phone and edit them there.  thanks, samsung for discontinuing what i need and adding what i don't,  like stupid bixby.  should i go to apple store and check  their iphones?  i tried other
they had a chance to fix all the laggy, unusable features. another forced bixby (it insists upon itself). i have both this and the iphone x. surprise, guess which one just works out of the box (spoiler alert: iphone). i was so excited about this phone, but it has maybe a (marginally) better camera setup than the s8+. its at least as laggy as the last phone. its not worth the price, flagship or not. if youre os agnostic, get an iphone. this is way more trouble than its worth. it arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.  also, in typical android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. every app you install makes the phone that much slower. this is an android problem, same thing happens on the pixel 2 xl. i should have stuck with the pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.  it has a nice screen though, but i like the iphones screen as much. this is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from samsung. maybe itll catch fire like the note and ill be able to be rid of this phone.
i received it on april 11 2018 and sadly it was used. as soon as i opened the box, phone was upside down, box was disorganized and headphones & cables misplaced. i needed the phone so much that i stayed with it but if you have another option simply go for another one.
worst phone ever!!! it keeps randomly deleting most of my pictures and my game notidication sounds dot work!!! worst phone ever!!!
why is that me samsung galaxy s9+,doesn't have a samsung headphone, instead a different name on it?
plug garbage. can't use any normal android. plug. would not have bought. returning to these dopes
great phone. sucks that i can't connect to the wifi due to a 25 character password limit and i've got an unchangeable password. guess there's not going to be using much of the fun new features.
