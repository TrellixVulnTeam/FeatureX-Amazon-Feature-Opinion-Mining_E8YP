In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.<br /><br />This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the Home button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!<br /><br />The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.<br /><br />When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then Ive been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds its low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in Camera). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) Foodies, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!<br /><br />Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my Talk and Surf function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so its a toss up!<br /><br />As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and havent gone back!  ",5,positive

After only a few weeks, I realized that I made a huge mistake to give Samsung a third chance (after owning a washer/dryer that died after only 4 years and a TV that came apart and had to be exchanged for a Sony TV after less than a week).<br /><br />First, Samsung's bloatware really ruins the experience. However, with sweat, blood, and tears you can remove most of it. You can even disable Bixby and turn your Galaxy S8+ into the first phone with a non-functional hardware button. However, you cannot have hands-free Google Assistant, even though Samsung advertises this feature.<br /><br />Second, the hardware is fragile. I had my phone in a Samsung case since day one and it still managed to get a deep long scratch on the back. I didn't drop it. It was never outside the case. It was not a third-party case. I'm not a savage. For example, I've never scratched any of my previous iPhones in the span of nearly a decade.<br /><br />Third, don't bother paying for or seeking support. You'll first talk to support that turns out to be volunteers, yet it is made to look like official Samsung support. Then you're given a phone number to call support and ten minutes into the call they mention Premium Support. You then respond with... ""Wait, your not Premium Support"" and they give you yet another number to call. So, you call Premium Support, which costs $288 for 2 years by the way, and are told that you have to pay the $99 deductible even in this case. I then learn that I'm actually talking to someone from Assurant who has zero flexibility. They tell me that they can connect me with Premium Support though. After several minutes I learn that there actually is no other Premium Support entity and that you're really just dealing with an inflexible insurance and that Samsung doesn't stand behind their products.<br /><br />I understand that there are a deductible and fine print but Samsung should also understand that I only do business with companies that stand behind the quality of their products. I didn't drop the phone or use it without a case. I used it with a Samsung case that ended up causing a scratch on the supposedly ultrastrong glass back. If it weren't for Apple's lackluster iPhone releases in the past 3 years I would've never given them a third chance. There will absolutely not be a fourth chance.<br /><br />You'll see this phone on Craigslist very soon and I'll be returning all my Samsung accessories over the weekend.",2,negative

As others have stated, I too questioned if the phone was a fake or not because it did not come with the Samsung S8+ logo on the back, it just says Samsung with a printed label attached with the model number and IMEI on it.<br />Pros- In all its a good phone.  Samsung did well and always has. The picture quality is like no other.  The screen is sleek and call and music quality is great.<br />Cons-This phone has locked features that are displayed in Chinese. I can not remove and make it English. The phone also will not pair to any Bluetooth device. The only reason I have not sent it back was because even though I had a gorilla glass screen on the phone.  Within the first 5 hours of my using it, my umbrella hit the phone in a spot that was not protected by the gorilla glass and cracked my screen leaving a visible chip near the speaker on top. So I have a chipped screen and it does not connect to Bluetooth that I need. Because the phone is the ""Asian"" version, I also can't use Samsung pay because the United States is not one of the selected country options listed on this phone. Just not a happy girl. I should have just waited for the Note 8.<br />If anyone knows how to change the internal setting to make it an English version and to help with the Bluetooth connection. Please help!",1,negative

B06Y15G61T,"on March 29, 2018",amzn1.account.AHEOOLOJYBNZETPA7ZOOX3M3X5PQ,CONSTANTLY keeps turning itself on,"I got this phone from Verizon. It has lots of good features, but it can't be used with a Mophie juice pack because it keeps turning the screen on when it's charging. According to online discussion groups, it's a design flaw in the phone. I changed all the settings to keep the phone turned off. I called Samsung, and the tech took over my phone and verified that all the settings were where they should be for the phone not to keep turning itself on. No use -- it still turns itself on every few seconds, sometimes with a pop-up saying that the phone would charge faster with a charging cord from Samsung. The tech told me to do a factory reset, which is what they say when they have no idea what's wrong. That didn't work either, as other posters on online discussion groups said it wouldn't. The tech couldn't suggest anything else except sending the phone in for repair, but that seems pointless when it's not this particular unit that's at fault; it's a known flaw in the design. It's not as bad as catching on fire, as the Note 7 did, but you'd think that a company the size of Samsung could find engineers capable of designing a phone that doesn't keep turning the screen on over and over and over. It's especially annoying at night, when you turn off the screen, and seconds later it turns back on. You turn it off. It turns back on. You turn it off. It turns back on. If you plug it in with a Samsung cord, it'll stop for a while; but as soon as it's fully charged, here comes that bright screen again.",1,negative

And here is the second problem... WARRANTY IS ONLY VALID IN THE U.S.!!!, Samsung it's not like Apple, Samsung warranty is local on phones so forget it you think Samsung will accept your warranty elsewhere. I went to Samsung Colombia and their preliminary analysis is that they are not sure if the problem is with the camera (70% probability) or the board.  At this time I have not yet decided if sending  the phone to US for warranty or take it to Samsung Colombia at my own expense. If the hardware problem is with the camera, the replacement will cost me like US$100-150.  Because I saved US$350  buying the phone in US,  it still makes a good deal and the camera replacement will give me a year of warranty on phone's camera in Colombia.<br />Beware because this ""Warning Camera Fail"" error its a very commune HARDWARE issue on the S8/S8+ models. I have bough several Samsung phones, they are excellent and will buy Samsung again... I just wasn't lucky with this one.<br /><br />The phone works perfectly well in Colombia (GSM-LTE 4G), it gets the updates on time. I have not taken it to other countries yet.",2,negative

I have several in my home. However, when something goes wrong and you need to send the product in for service and repair, good luck!<br />I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge earlier in the year after being a loyal iPhone user since the 3GS. When I made the switch I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the phone. It worked flawlessly for about six months until a firmware update they release trashed the phone. Took it to a local Samsung rep. at Best Buy and he tried for a day and a half to replace the operating system with no luck. He said that it is still under warranty so send it in and theyll fix it. Sounded great, however.<br />I called their customer service number and they stared a claim, she took my information down and told me it will take around eleven days to get it back, then issued me a UPS label. I sent the phone off to them and they send me an email on June 27th confirming that they received the phone and issued me a ticket number. So far so good right?<br />Well after the first week when by I decided to check the status of my repair through the Repair Self Tracking portal they have and was surprised to see that there was nothing in their system about my repair claim. Though to myself, thats weird.<br />On July 13th, after thirteen business days later of not hearing anything I called them again to check the status. They said that they were done with it but I gave them a P.O. Box address and that they can only delver to a physical address. Oh, ok I get it, a mistake. However, when the person who originally took my information shouldnt she have told me that they required a physical address? Still, not too upset. They told me that they would ship it immediately and I would have it in 1-4 business days. Great? Not so fast.<br />Five business days later on July 20th I still had not received my phone so I called again. The Samsung rep I talked to this time said pretty much the same thing that the last rep told me and that it has not been shipped. Now Im irritated. I told him that they had the correct address now so whats the problem?  He put me on hold and checked with the repair shop and a Anne told him that they would overnight it today and I would receive it tomorrow. This is where it gets really shady. I asked this person to please send me an email stating our conversation and confirming that the phone was being shipped overnight. He told me that they do not have the capability to send emails. What? Samsung cant send emails? I was pissed off so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold for a really long time and came back to tell me that his supervisor Graham will not speak with me and that he doesnt have the capability to send an email either. Now Im furious. Im being lied to and this is getting really shady. Im not sure they even have my phone at this point. He put me on hold again and talked to Anne again who told him that when they sip it later today, I would receive an email stating that it shipped. I was not happy and expressed it vividly.<br />I then went on the web trying to find another number to contact or call someone above them all with no luck. So what I found is that if these people want to screw you over, theres no one else to get involved or help. What a predicament.<br />Later the same day (July 20th) I called again and talked to another representative name Angela. She checked the status and let me know that it shows on her end that my phone is scheduled to be shipped overnight and I should have tomorrow. I wasnt holding my breath at this point.<br />Well here I am now, today is July 26th and yes, still no phone. I am beyond upset and dont know if I will ever get my phone back. Im thinking I am going to have to get an attorney involved which will likely cost more than a new phone. I can tell you this, if this can happen to your phone, it can happen to all Samsung products. I will be switching back to an iPhone here shortly if I dont get my phone by this Friday. I caution you to ever think about buying another product from Samsung again.",1,negative

B06Y15G61T,"on July 22, 2017",amzn1.account.AEYAGPZ5NOW5YTSITNEJTOPIVR4A,Pros & Cons,"My wife and I have had the Samsung S8+ for a little over a week now. I am an avid Samsung Galaxy user, and have been using them since the 4th generation. Here are the pros and cons as I see them to this device.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Android Nougat is a very smooth OS. It's a definite upgrade from the previous versions. Just keeps getting better.<br />- The cameras on this phone are both amazing. Makes great photos!<br />- Very slick design on phone, aesthetically speaking. It looks very nice.<br />- Comes with a nice variety of accessories, including adapters for charging in case you want to use a micro-USB charger or want to hook up a USB cable accessory for any reason.<br />- Extremely good graphics on this device. Resolution is phenomenal.<br />- Wide range of settings for customizing your user experience and security. (Even more than the usual for an Android/Samsung device)<br />- Continued to allow for external storage, unlike the S6, which made me very happy.<br />- I haven't put the water resistance to the test, but I'm assuming it's as good as the last model. Glad it's there.<br />- The full screen layout is very nice for movies and gaming. I adjusted to the homescreen button being part of the screen almost instantly.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- This is an EXTREMELY fragile design, especially the back of the phone, which is also coated in the Gorilla Glass, from what I can tell. My wife dropped hers from about 10 inches, with a case on, on the 5th day of ownership. The back of the phone cracked, chipped, and spider-webed all over within just a few hours. The phone was insured through our carrier, but the cheapest solution was to send it in to Samsung for a $75 repair job (plus shipping and handling). I would strongly recommend using a reputable case and screen protector at all costs. And be sure you insure this device. Lots of the durability tests that I have seen on YouTube have exposed this design flaw as well.<br />- The headphones that come with the phone aren't that great. In previous editions, they provided Samsung-brand headphones that sounded great. It looks like they've started using another company to produce their headphones. There is very little bass or mid-range in the sound, so if you use your headphones for music, gaming, or videos, be prepared to get a better brand.<br />- The new Bixby application via Samsung... I'm still trying to adjust to it. It's Samsung's version of Google Assistant/Siri. It's not that it's not a useful concept, but you don't get much of a choice but to use it. There's a dedicated button on the left of the phone that can not be deactivated from what I can tell. It's right below the volume button and is easy to press unknowingly and can get annoying quickly. I hope Bixby grows on me.<br />- The voice command features for both Google and Bixby is weak in this edition. I have had to reprogram my voice recognition settings about 5 times already, and it still only picks up the commands about 30% of the time. Oddly enough, it works much better for the Bixby service than the Google Assistant service. (That struck me as a bit suspicious)<br />- The speech-to-text application in general took a step backwards with this edition. My S7 and S6 both did a wonderful job for the most part of translating my speech. This phone, however, has massive errors in its translation. It hyphenates words that don't need to be and substitutes words incorrectly, and often. I have to speak EXTREMELY slowly and phonetically in order to get it to work. The fact that I have a Southern accent doesn't help whatsoever. This was one of the worst drawbacks for me, personally, because I use the speech-to-text feature often with my work.<br /><br />Overall: It's a gorgeous phone with some definite upgrades but concerning drawbacks. If I were Samsung, I would put a lot of emphasis on making a more durable design on the future editions. Worth buying - just keep it well protected.",3,negative

The first thing I did is remove the auto updates on all of the apps I didn't want or need in the first place. Too bad I can't remove them.<br />Ring tone defaults are weird and that's the second thing to fix. You also will have to set everything up so you are able to get your MMS messages since the phone comes unlocked, but I expected that.<br />The screen is beautiful. Once I have it in a case, it's much larger than I expected, which is a good and bad thing. Sound quality has been good so far, but I typically talk through a Bluetooth (either headset or car speakers).<br />One thing I did not realize is that this phone does not charge with the standard micro USB. It is not as inconvenient as I first thought because the adapters are readily available and cheap, so I'm just ordering several of them. I'll also give the wireless charger a try.<br />I do think I'll learn to love this phone in time once I get used to all of the Samsung quirks again.<br />Pros: Great picture, and easy to read/work on documents for work. Once it's organized and personalized, the layout makes sense like any android.<br />Cons: different charger, stays lit all of the time (draining battery) to show the clock (although there might be a setting I haven't found to fix that).",4,positive

B06Y15G61T,"on July 2, 2017",amzn1.account.AELZCZUPC3ZSRIKRYMRU7FS5H2VA,Loaded with bloatware,"If you bought a Samsung S8+, you now have Bixby, a piece of bloatware written by a group of teenagers tasked by Samsung with imitating Google Now, Alexa, Cortana, and Siri. The result is absolutely catastrophic and reminds of Word 1.0 (if you are old enough). The software still does not recognize voice  no, its not just because of my accent  making it perfectly useless.<br /><br />The catch is that this assistant  which would be called Jar Jar Binks if it was from a galaxy far far away  is tied to a side button. As soon as the S8 was released, people came up with Google Play applications to remap this button or to disable the software altogether. Samsung retaliated by releasing an update to prevent the hack from working. It lasted for a week until a clever developer found a countermeasure.<br /><br />One million people have downloaded one of the anti-Bixby programs on Google Play. The other Samsung S8 users are probably trying to figure how to do it, I guess. Well done, Samsung! You have released another Galaxy Note 7...<br /><br />So, I will now give you a way to BOTH disable the pathetic Bixby AND remap the button.<br /><br />1. Download Package Disabler Pro<br />2. Search for the Bixby software in ""Package Disabler Pro"" and disable all EXCEPT Bixby Home and Bixby Voice. They will be rendered harmless without the services except that they detect the button press and raise an event. You can disable the rest of the Samsung bloatware while youre at it.<br />3. Install the BxAction software from Google Play<br />4. The BxAction software detects the raised event from step 2 and it will be able to start another app.<br />5.

B06Y15G61T,"on June 26, 2017",amzn1.account.AHJED44JHCW4ATDA2K2MQRWPZQ7A,"Almost perfect--but with a couple problems that won't be big for some, but were huge for me","Over the last few years I've owned the original (Gigantic) Galaxy Note, a Motorola Droid, Nexus 4, LG G3, Galaxy S6 Edge+, GS7 and now the S8+. I had planned on getting the Note 7 instead of the GS7 but I think we all know how that turned out. I came really close to buying the LG V20 but what essentially helped make my decision was wireless charging. No matter how gimmicky you think it is, once you get used to it, you'll not want to give it up, I promise. I wasn't eligible for an upgrade until after the Note 8 is released, but I changed jobs and they gave me a S8+ and I jumped at it.<br /><br />First off, it's not perfect--and I'll go into why I withdrew that last star in a bit. It may be trivial to YOU, but for me, it was enough to not give it a perfect score. Next, lets discuss the first thing you notice: that Infinity Display. I've had several iPhone die hard fans actually look at it in utter jealousy. Its hard not to. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus with a paltry 5.5"" screen and just 1920 X 1080 resolution vs Full HD Plus (2960 x 1440) is just one of the reasons why this phone beats the dated apple device hands down. The S8 and the S8+ are dramatically different from their predecessors with a completely new aspect ratio which makes the device taller and thinner. With a 6.2"" screen you'll be amazed that they managed to cram that amazing display in a body only slightly taller than the iPhone 7 Plus and definitely narrower and less than a millimeter thicker. The argument that eliminating headphone jack meant giving iPhone users bigger batteries and other nifty goodies is proven categorically to be just hot air since Samsung managed a 3500 mAh battery in the S8+ AND a headphone jack. No matter how old the technology is, say what you want, but it still works better than bluetooth earbuds--at least as I write this. It won't be long before bluetooth will genuinely equal the quality of corded earbuds...but that day is not today.<br /><br />The build is exceptional and very futuristic looking, easily leaving all other designs in the proverbial dust. I can't think of any other device with a screen that is as close to taking up the entire face of a phone as much as the GS8's. I keep hearing that a move to 4K displays are a foregone conclusion and not that anyone will take MY word for it, but I honestly believe that is entirely unnecessary. I would much rather phones keep the current resolution and concentrate more on battery life. Upping the screen resolution only puts more strain on the battery to illuminate all those extra pixels and I promise you, the screen tech is out-pacing battery ability right now. Samsung, leave it alone until you can make 4K at least as good as the battery life on current models with less. The front and back are Gorilla Glass 5 and while it is durable and scratch resistant, it is STILL vulnerable to breaking, even from short drops onto very hard surfaces, so do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD case to protect your investment. After all, its not a question of IF you're going to drop it, but when. Also, that glass on front and back make it a bit on the slippery side, so despite the all premium build, it ISN'T without some flaws built into that really nice exterior.<br /><br />The S8 keeps the IP68 rating of the GS7 and while the speaker can get loud, its rather tinny and won't reproduce music to the degree the iPhone 7 can. If that isn't a priority for you, then don't worry, but if its a big deal, you may consider thinking of something different. I would imagine the IP68 certification has something to do with the quality of the speaker, too. I suppose you need to make some sacrifices--though if I'm being honest, the iPhone has a slightly less rating (IP67) but yet still has great speakers, so its something to consider...but remember the GS8 has a headphone jack while the iPhone doesn't. Trade one for the other I guess.<br /><br />Okay, my gripes. I have two so far. On my GS7 when I hit the home key and then swiped to unlock the phone it was almost instantaneously unlocked. For some reason, once I press the power button (now on the right side of the screen) and then swipe up to unlock the screen, it doesn't work. I have to wait almost a full second before I can actually swipe. Yes, I know, First World Problems...but is it entirely unreasonable to expect a newer device to be at the very least AS fast doing this as the previous model? I don't think so. My other gripe may not be an issue for many of you at all, but I can assure you for me it truly is. One of the many advantages Android has over iOS is customizing. I like several different keyboards and while the stock Samsung keyboard is okay, it is far from what I like--in fact I don't use it at all. I prefer GBoard, Swype and Swiftkey Flow. Before, if I wanted to switch from one keyboard to another while I was texting, as long as the keyboard was visible on the screen, you just swiped down from the top and the option to switch keyboards was right there. For some reason they have left this option off of the S8. For the life of my I cannot figure out why. Again, the ability to easily customize Android has always been a huge selling point for me (and I know many of you) so now making this feature more difficult to access makes no sense and honestly, Samsung, you NEED TO FIX THIS ASAP. It pissed me off enough that I totally docked a star from my review almost entirely because of this one thing. Now, for those of you who rarely or never really change your keyboard, this won't be an issue whatsoever, but I can assure you for me it was an enormous pain in my backside.<br /><br />Going from the S6 to the S7 I noticed virtually no difference in the speed of either model. I was expecting to see a bump in performance when I got the S7 but nope. However, the same cannot be said of the S8. I have noticed a very noticeable bump in performance and battery improvement, even though the S8+ has a slightly smaller battery than the S7 (from 3600 to 3500 mAh). In fact I have noticed a marked battery improvement as well. This is supposedly due to the much smaller and more efficient and faster chipset used. Not sure if that's it, but it certainly was a welcome change of pace. You can squeeze a bit more juice out of your phone by changing the screen brightness and resolution without missing out on much at all. I keep mine at the setting that came stock (which is not the highest resolution out of the box, strangely enough) because I cannot tell a difference. There are also different performance settings for gaming and whatnot that can drastically reduce battery length, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />I tried playing with the Iris scanner and fingerprint reader. My honest belief is this: while its probably important to keep security on your device, I tend to have none. I know, I know, its not wise, but hey, sue me. The Iris scanner though DID seem to work pretty well and rather quick, too. I was impressed with its speed, though it does take a bit of practice to align your eyes with the forward camera before you can truly take advantage of that speed, but it doesn't take long. The placement of the fingerprint scanner was a HUGE debate leading up to the GS8's release. Will it be an issue? That is entirely up to you. The 8+ is a tall device and if you have small or short fingers, yes it'll probably will be. Wherever possible, I recommend you go into a store and hold one in your hand and see for yourself before making the purchase. It could make a world of difference for you. I didn't try using the face unlock feature at all. Androids in years past had it and I just never thought it was very secure (ha, like I care). Keep in mind a sufficiently close photo of you could unlock the phone, too.<br /><br />I've noticed on the always on display that the selection of screens seems to be smaller than the GS7. Not sure if I simply cannot find the other options or whether or not that is just true--but either way, I thought I'd mention it. The basic one that is at launch works fine for me, so no complaints there.<br /><br />Bixby. Honestly, I cannot figure out why they made such a stink about it when they announced the device only to launch it without 95% of its ability to do what they ""claimed"" it would. They even devoted a button exclusively to its use, which is a waste you cannot truly re-map it. Supposedly you could at its launch, but Samsung reportedly forwarded a patch that would make that useless (or so I've heard). The good news is that Google Now DOES come pre-installed and works as brilliant as always. There is a different way to access it, well, slightly different anyway. Before if you long pressed on the home button it'd launch, but now you just press the built-in screen home button and hold it instead. Still works and since I had always thought S-Voice was an embarrassment of a virtual assistant, I have very low expectations for Bixby, which Samsung insists WILL be arriving soon before the end of this year. If I'm wrong I'll be happy to admit it...but somehow I just doubt it. From what I hear though, Bixby was developed by the same people who did Siri for apple, so who knows, maybe it WILL be all Samsung claims it will be. Time will tell. In the meantime Google Now is my friend.<br /><br />I love how the GS8 comes with standard 64 GB of memory and also includes the ability to add more, unlike apple. Great option and I have more memory available after moving all my stuff from my old phone over than my GS7 came with, now that's nice. I have an expansion card, but I doubt I'll need it, but you never know. It's nice to have either way.<br /><br />The cameras are great. Where they truly shine is not only are they great front and back, but both have f1.7 aperture. So they absolutely are stellar at taking low-light photos, yes, even better than the iPhone 7 (if only slightly so). I think bumping up the front camera to 8MP was a smart move. With the popularity of selfies not slowing down, it was a wise precaution. Making it also auto focus like the unbelievably FAST back camera was utter brilliance. It may not have image stabilization like the back, but hey, better is better. The S8 is also the first mobile device certified to play HDR content, which is fancy talk for saying your viewing will be bright & crisp and virtually without equal. Now when iPhone releases their next model, I would expect it to be received as just shy of blessed from On High as the greatest this or that no matter how much of its new bells and whistles first appeared on an Android device...that doesn't mean apple is without ability to innovate (3D touch comes to mind) but I would expect the next version to have a great camera as usual and a few other bells & whistles. It remains to be seen if it'll have the in-screen thumbprint reader as it was also rumored the GS8 would have as well, but they weren't able to perfect it in time, hence the awkward placement of the thumbprint reader on back, or maybe the tech isn't capable at this point to pull it off, I don't know. Maybe the next iPhone will have it, maybe not. We'll find out one way or another soon enough. If they pull it off, good for them. I would expect then to see one on the upcoming Note 8, but nothing is certain.<br /><br />One more thing, the addition of the USB Type C charger was awesome. As frustrating as it is to have to buy all new cords (I have like a bazillion of the Micro USB charging cords all over) I find the new design to be a very welcome one. Let's be honest, we've all gone to plug in one to our phones only to discover that you had it upside down, right? Gosh it was frustrating. Its nice to not have to worry about whether or not its upside down. They also came out with an adapter so you can still use an older Micro USB which was very convenient as well. The continuation of wireless charging and fast charging is always very convenient. I love plugging in my phone after my coworker has started charging their iPhone, and in less time I've topped my phone off and a few have even accused me of making it up--til I proved it. Their reaction: almost always, ""Wow! That's amazing!"" I think the next iPhone will probably (finally) adapt that along with possibly wireless charging. They'd be stupid not to.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No. But its a good improvement over the GS7, enough so that I can happily endorse it to anyone who is looking to impress their die hard apple fanboy friends, or simply to just have a great device all the way around.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />I discovered, quite by accident, how to change keyboards--my biggest complaint about the phone--just as simple as the old method. It isn't as obvious as it was before, and to be candid, I still don't know why they changed it so much, but it IS just as simple to change keyboards as it was before. For example, if you are in your messaging app and your current keyboard is displayed, at the bottom of the screen you'll see your usual options, recent, home and back on-screen buttons, but to the far right is an icon that kind of looks like a keyboard. It's not as obvious as I think it should be, but by touching that icon you'll get a drop-down menu to change your keyboard. Again, its quick, simple if not obvious. It works and works well, I just wish Samsung had made that feature a bit more easier to figure out. With that feature now available, I bump my rating to a full 4.5 stars. My apologies for not noticing it earlier.",4,positive

The other day I had my phone in my front pocket and bent down. the phone dropped out and landed on the ground face down. Now it was only 10""-12"" from the ground and when it occurred I said, ""damn"" to myself but remembered it had gorilla glass 5 on it so not a problem. Later on looking at the phone I saw a scratch and on further inspection it revealed a crack that went across the phone 3 ways. I have had a Samsung 4 and 6 and never had a problem with a screen when they dropped before. So beware for the gorilla glass is not all cracked up to what they are saying. To say the least I am disappointed at Samsung creating a top notch phone with a screen that is so easily damaged.

I've literally been counting down the days since the release date was announced. I am so frustrated with this inconsistent piece of crap. This thing cost me too much money to be so upset about the functionality or, lack thereof... The spilt screen feature is terrible. It was much better on the s6, and the s6 was a disaster. The keyboard is awful, apps crash constantly, the back button will sometimes take you back one page, and sometimes will land you on the home screen. The sound quality is abysmal. The volume with headphones is about half what it needs to be. The battery lasts about eight hours, with normal use, in entertainment mode (which is opening a whole new can of worms, as entertainment mode should be standard. The biggest selling point of the phone is the incredible display, and you're telling me that it isn't wise to use it to it's fullest potential?) A giant failure on the part of Samsung. I believe the hyped reviews have been bought and paid for by Samsung, who has been in damage control for two years, and really needed this phone to be successful. I'm done with Samsung. I will never buy another Samsung product again, not in some effort to hurt samsung, but to keep their substandard crap out of my home.

Ultimately a few odd design decisions keep this from achieving a full 5 star review from me.<br /><br />PROS<br />-The best looking screen on any mass market phone ever produced<br />-Excellent camera performance<br />-Lighter version of Touchwiz (Samsung OS) including the ability to disable and uninstall bloatware<br />-Not too big to hold (a bit long though)<br />-Solid battery performance<br /><br />CONS<br />-Odd positioning of a dedicated button for ""Bixby"" Samsung's assistant software.  This button is far too close to the volume down button and I hit it constantly by accident.  Worse yet, it can't be disabled without downloading a third party app.  Even worse, Bixby itself is not anywhere near as useful as Google assistant.  Samsung...PLEASE stop messing with software.  Leave Google alone, this is their core business competency and your incessant layering on of useless features (now coming with a dedicated button) is obscene.  This design flaw will ultimately drive me to a Google Pixel upon their next release (most likely Fall 2017).<br />-Odd positioning of the fingerprint sensor.  Way too far up on the phone which makes it hard to reach, right next to the camera lens.  Bad design.<br />-Fragile glass.  I dropped it from between knee and waist height one time and the glass cracked.  If you buy, you must invest in a screen protector.<br /><br />Ultimately if you can deal with the annoyances listed above you should have no reservations buying this phone.  The screen itself is worth the investment.  Every time I show someone a photo on my camera they comment on how good it looks.  Here's to hoping Samsung scratches the Bixby button, embeds the finger print reader in the screen, and offers a pure Android version.  That to me would be the perfect phone.",4,positive

Speed, size, display, camera, overall experience  No other phone can touch the s8 plus with the possible exception of iPhone X, and, as an owner of both who loves his iPhone X, I cant see any reason for an Android user to switch platforms. My biz phone is iPhone, home phone is s8 Plus, and the 0nly tiebreaker is my Apple Watch 3 LTE. THAT is unrivaled, but if youre wed to Android, the Samsung Gear 3 is pretty darned good. As regards phone design, Apple has caught up to Samsung with the X, but not convincingly passed it.

I received my device literally within 2-3 days of placing my order. For those confused about the difference between the international version and the us unlocked version I would like to offer some clarity. The main differences between the two are that on the international verison you may or may not be able to use Samsung Pay depending on your devices country of origin. You will not be able to utilize your carriers specific features like hd voice, WiFi calling etc. The international verison features Samsungs exynos processor versus snapdragon. I use AT&T and my device works absolutely fine. The device I received had the model number SM-G955F which is the Spain version.

FINALLY, I purchased a phone from Amazon that said it was ""new"" and it is!  This is the 3rd one that I had to buy to have that happen.  The other 2 sellers listed their phones as new and when they arrived the seal was broken or totally taken off all together.  The first guy actually put a new sticker that said ""do not accept if seal is broken"" over top of the original ""broken"" sticker.  The second guy just removed the sticker altogether so there wasn't a sticker at all.  I've bought a slew of Samsung phones over the years and I knew what to expect, but if you didn't know, you would probably wouldn't realize the difference.

Curved screen is unnecessary and sometimes while holding the phone to watch a video you may mess with the screen accidentally on the edges. Speaker is in a terrible spot speaking of holding the phone sideways to watch videos your finger will cover the speaker. Dropped it once and the corner shattered, really disappointing. I think the one thing that has really bothered me the most was the keyboard/word prediction. It seems to not know English very well and corrects you with odd words or is somewhat difficult to customize properly. I had to download a different keyboard that is probably equally as annoying any way. Best thing is the secure folder with fingerprint or Iris lock capabilities I believe, fingerprint for sure. Secret web browsing mode as well. Hide certain apps/images/folders you name it pretty much. Don't know if I would actually recommend.
