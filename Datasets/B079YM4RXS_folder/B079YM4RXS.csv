B079YM4RXS,"on May 23, 2018",amzn1.account.AFZI3QE54JK4X7JEFRDDKTXJNCOQ,Tale of Two Phones,"This is my second Moto Z.  I purchased one last year, and really like it.  Overall, it is a solid phone.  My biggest issue is with the ridiculous desire by Lenovo/Motorola to make this the ""thinnest"" phone for some reason.  This results in a product with limited battery life.  I wanted a wireless charging phone, and with the wireless charging back shell, this works well.  After going this route, I decided to find one of the wireless charging battery pack Moto Mods, which are out there, but not as readily available as some of the other novelty mods.<br /><br />The design of the phone, with the desire to have either a wireless or wireless/battery mod mounted all of the time severely limits protection choices.  The only comfortable choice I could locate was the Incipio bumper case.  But you'll need to make sure you get the right one.  The Moto Z, Moto Z Play and Moto Z Force all have different phone dimensions (thicknesses) resulting in a spat of bad reviews for this case (i.e. phone falls out of case).<br /><br />One of the reasons I have gravitated to the Lenovo/Motorola phones was the limited modifications to the stock Android platform.  Unfortunately, one of my previous purchases after the early Moto G phones, was a Moto X Pure Edition........which was supposed to see quicker updates.  Not even close.  My first Moto Z though already received the Oreo update two weeks ago.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that was about the same time my phone took a tumble and cracked the corner of the glass screen.  I decided to replace this phone with another Moto Z, so I bought my second one and received it yesterday.  I always try to purchase items on Amazon that are actually ""fulfilled by Amazon"", regardless of the seller.  This usually means that I get what I ordered.  In setting it up and loading the updates, I realized that something was ""off.""  After looking at the phone details, I realized that what I received was not a US edition (Software Channel = retus).  Instead, I received an Asion Pacific variant (Software Channel = retapac).  This meant that the Oreo update my previous Moto Z got did not come through on this phone.<br /><br />I requested a call from Amazon Technical Support.  The customer service rep was very pleasant, but had to arrange a return of this phone, as it is not the US Retail version as advertised.  In addition, I'm not going to purchase another and gamble on having to return that one.<br /><br />Overall, I like the power and overall performance of the Moto Z, but I'm not sure making this purchase on Amazon is the best choice anymore.",4,positive

I've been a Motorola customer back to the Razr and Atrix, and absolutely loved the 1st gen Moto X.  The lightly skinned Android experience with the added Moto display, made this exactly what I wanted in my phone.  At least until the battery died.  Every phone owner understands battery degradation, but this is beyond degradation.  The phone is useless unless plugged into the wall or into a portable charger.  Even my Moto Mod battery pack is unable to keep it on without random shutdowns and the inability to power up without being plugged in.  If you read the 100+ pages in the Lenovo/Motorola forum regarding the battery issue, it's surprising that nothing is being done to help the owners of this phone other than to recommend sending in for service.  And since a good chunk of people are now outside of warranty, it'll cost you $150+ for replacement/repair.  With this phone dying after 15 months of use, I couldn't convince myself that a replacement would get me much mileage, so the only solution is to look for a new phone that will not be a Motorola.",1,negative

Have to say that I really like it.  It's fast, capable, and the fingerprint sensor works sooo much better than my old phone did.  The screen visibiity inside and out is slightly better than the old s5. Both use AMOLED technology.<br /><br />It is large, but comfortable to hold.  Mine came with a wood-grain back cover, a bumper, data cord, separate power cord (was the Euro-220v type, but had an adapter), headphones, 3.5mm to USB-C adapter for the headphones, and a small pick to open the sim-sd card drawer.<br /><br />The phone can accept either a second sim card OR a micro-SD card, it uses nano-sim cards, fwiw..  Which will mean that I can keep the other sim card in place for when I travel outside of the country,  With 64gb memory, and cloud storage, I'm not terribly worried about SD card storage.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze, it auto-connected to both my google account and  to my service provider  so no huge setup was needed.,<br /><br />When it arrived,, it had 83% charge.  Charging time is reasonable, but it is a battery hog.  I have the Moto-z mod for extra battery power arriving in a day or 2, which should take care of that problem for me.  But so far, I've never dipped below about 30%, and I use the phone all of the time.<br /><br />The camera is fantastic, the included app is ok, but when I used the 'HD Camera App', it was even better.<br /><br />This phone has been fast responsive and a pleasure to use; at this price, it's a great deal.",5,positive

The phone has locked itself into speaker mode - people phone in the office and I answer and I used to get blasted with full speaker in the ear. I have since learned to adjust for this annoyance, but I shouldn't need to. Then the hands free calling kind of sucks. it used to work OK, but after the ""update"", I now get the joy of having my car tell me there is an incoming call, and when I press the steering wheel button to answer it, the handset speaker is what I get to hear - not coming out of my car. Again, I have learned to adjust for this annoyance, but I shouldn't need to. Oh yeah, there was one time I found a serious bug in the Accessibility menu, called Talk Back. If you have never used it, DO NOT DO TURN IT ON!!! You will be locked out of your menu and you will be stuck in this alternate dimension where nothing you do will undo what you just did. The controls that used to work, no longer work. I found myself turning the phone on and off several times and pressing whatever buttons I could find to get back to the accessibility menu and turning it off. Funny they would put such an option under the Accessibility Menu - it's like putting a Sputter and Quit button on the dash in your car. Game play is out of the question unless I have a battery pack or charger nearby. Access to the internet is amazing almost everywhere and I love the size, but these buggy issues have me regretting my decision to buy this phone.",2,negative

The front flash is amazing for selfies (if you're into that sort of thing).<br />I don't mind not having a headphone jack because I have Samsung Gear IconX earphones and Bluedio U (UFO) bluetooth headphones.I'm all in on the bluetooth future so the head phone jack doesn't actually bother me.<br />The Moto Z is incredibly well built and the thinness of the device is amazing. I marvel at it's design every time I pick it up to perform a task.<br />The OS is the Google Now Launcher, so if you've used that before you'll love the simplicity and snappiness of the OS. The little tweaks, like chop twice for flashlight and twist to launch the camera are bonus's that make this phone even better. It is able to upgrade to 7.0 out the box so you'll have almost the latest Android (7.1.1 is the latest)<br /><br />The one con is the battery life. Because the device is 5 mm thin, it has less than the 3000 mAh I think you need to run a snapdragon 820 with a 1440p 5.5"" display.

B079YM4RXS,"on February 16, 2017",amzn1.account.AE2FARTJZ2PG4SCRCGWEQKODJPDA,"Excellent On AT&T, Android 7 Update Live","Initial Review: 2/16/2017<br /><br />I will break this down as best as I can.  To begin, I have AT&T and am coming from a Moto X Pure and before that, an HTC One M8.<br /><br />My Moto X Pure is still waiting for its Android 7 update.  And after reading some of the reviews on here I was worried that Motorola just forgot about this device.  However, as soon as I turned it on and logged on to my WiFi, I received an update notification for Android 7.  I set up my phone first, installed and customized a few apps, and then updated, which took 10 minutes of time and 6% of my battery life.  So there you have it.  The Android 7 update is live on this device.<br /><br />The overall tactile feel of the phone is amazing.  It comes with a wood magnetic backplate and a bumper cover which actually all look just fine when placed on the phone.  I still ordered a new case...protection!  You also get the usual manuals, a charger, and a small utility to pop open the SIM/memory card slot.  Also included is a USB-C to headphone plug adapter, which is nice, but it should have a charge port built into that adapter as when it's plugged in, you cannot charge the phone.<br /><br />The phone looks great as well.  I find the design very pleasing, although the bottom bezel protrudes a bit too far down and the camera kind of feels like I've got a rock stuck to the back of the phone lol.  But these are things that don't bother me.  What slightly bothers me is the removal of the headphone jack.  I use Bluetooth headphones so I don't have a problem here, but it might be a major problem to others.  And I strongly disagree with the decision by phone manufacturers to remove it.<br /><br />Screen:. Gorgeous screen.  I believe it's an AMOLED screen so go figure.  It has deep black levels and the viewing angles are good.  And it's actually quite bright.  I wasn't expecting that; my last phone with an AMOLED was my Galaxy S4 and that screen at its brightest was about 1/3 of the brightness of this.  I tested it in the sun today and at higher brightness levels, it is easily readable in sunlight.  Comparing this screen to the one on the Moto X Pure, I'd honestly have to give it to the X Pure.  Things are just ever-so slightly sharper, and I feel the colors are more accurate.<br /><br />Connectivity: I get about the same signal strength on GSM/LTE as I did with my X Pure, which was better than my HTC M8.  WiFi is really fast, Bluetooth works well, etc.  Everything here works just about as good as one would expect, at least on AT&T.<br /><br />UI: The UI is superb.  It's clean, simple, and extremely fast.  This is where the phone makes its night and day difference to me.  It is ridiculously faster than my Moto X Pure in almost every way: opening apps, browsing the web, general usage.  I'll also include bloatware here.  No carrier bloatware which is amazing and there isn't much preloaded to begin with.  It's pretty clean.<br /><br />Sound: Not as loud as my Moto X Pure or my HTC M8.  Both of those phones have dual front-firing speakers which make watching videos or listening to music a very pleasant experience.  Sound quality from the speaker is also pretty average.  I feel Motorola could have done a little more work here.  I've got the call volume maxed and I have very good hearing, but I still find it needs more of a boost.<br /><br />Battery Life: The jury is still out but it feels pretty close to my X Pure right now.  That phone has a 3000mah battery compared to 2600mah on the Z. I will update this as I get more information.<br /><br />Camera: Eh.  So the camera on my Moto X Pure is over 20 MP (4:3), 16 MP (16:9).  The camera on the Z is about 10 MP (16:9).  I have yet to take pictures and compare the two but on paper, the camera on the X may best the camera on the Z - will update.",5,positive

Especially after the Lenovo buyout, Moto just seems lost in their product design path.  They've gone crazy with large phones thinking the larger screen cures all ills while falling short in a lot of key areas.  As for the Moto Z, first let me say that the build quality is rock solid! And it really is unbelieavably thin!!!<br />BUT, it's a bit large in the hand..Wish they would've just gone with a 5.2 screen (something they haven't done since Moto X 2014).<br />I played around with a few of those mods but frankly it really didn't seem like any were worth the hefty price.<br /><br />My biggest two gripes about this phone (other than the large size) are camera & battery life.  I feel like the Camera isn't even as good as the Nexus 6P! In low light, the shutter takes a while and images have very heavy noise.  It's definitely not on par with other 2016 flagships; when will Motorola finally put a top of the line camera/imaging solution in a phone????<br />The battery life is seriously inadequate..it's a real struggle to make it through a whole day of moderate use.  I can understand they had to cut some corners to make it so thin but I wish instead they would've just included a 1080p screen to go a little easier on the battery life.  I also feel like this phone unlike previous Moto phones does not have as strong of a radio as other phones.  My reception readily drops in the elevator while using my Sony Xperia X Compact hangs on to a signal for the whole ride as did my old Moto X 2014.<br />Keeping my fingers crossed for a smaller flagship with an improved camera and battery life out of Motorola in 2017.",2,negative

The camera quality is great in daylight, but leaves much to be desired in low light (don't get me wrong though, it's far from being bad). I love the 1080p @ 60fps video recording. The fingerprint sensor is very fast and accurate. It has a single front facing speaker, but it's loud and clear. Battery life is good for me, I consistently get over 4hrs SOT. This device charges extremely fast, 0-100% in a little over an hour. I must say that I really love the mod ability concept (one of the main reasons I got this device). The only two mods I will be getting at the moment, however, are the JBL soundboost speaker mod and TUMI battery pack. One major con though is that this device hasn't received a single OS security update since launch (still running July 1st security patch), not to mention the Android 7.0 Nougat update which the Droid versions and other country retail versions users have been enjoying for months now. I had to install it manually, which I shouldn't have to do, however, I will still give this device a 5 star review.

Battery is AWFUL.,"Update (11 months in, end of October 2017)<br />I took the phone off the charger at 100% this morning at 6:15 am.  It is currently 10:30 am and the battery has died.  This is a problem.  I will not buy another Motorola product.  I listed to 45 minutes of podcasts this morning over bluetooth, scrolled through facebook for probably a combined 25 minutes, and updated 6 apps. I am changing my rating to a 1 star (from a 3 star) as this is inexcusable on a phone that is less than a year old. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.<br /><br />Update (7 months in, June 2017)<br />Battery life has become a problem.  I have factory reset the phone twice to temporarily improve battery life and keep only a few extra apps at a time on the phone.  I dont play games or anything else on the phone.  Yet, with the battery mod, the phone BARELY lasts all day.  Without the battery mod it wont even make it to 5pm.<br />The Processor has also become woefully inadequate.  The phone gets really hot when trying to do pretty simple things, like open snapchat, or update 2 or 3 apps.<br />The camera has also proven to be pretty bad.  Many of my pictures turn out blurry or generally poor quality vs my old Note 4.<br />Anymore it's definitely worth the money to get a newer, nicer phone.  Or a cheaper phone that doesn't have quite as high of expectations.<br />The Moto Z is a good phone overall, but Lenovo could do better.  I'll list some pros and cons and you can decide for yourself!<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Pros:<br />  Modularity: if this is something you're interested in, you can exchange the backs on the phone to different things such as a speaker, a battery  pack, a projector, or a fancier camera.  Most of these are in some way useful to some people.  I highly recommend the battery back and the speaker.<br />  Screen quality:  Beautiful screen blows many premium phones out of the water.  QHD does it's thing.<br />  Build Quality:  aluminum body, looks cool without any back on it at all (those gold pins though), and the Moto Mods fit very well.<br />  Software:  Motorola's ""skin"" over stock Android is VERY minimal and keeps things simple, unlike Samsung who tries really hard to make Android look like their own thing and makes it bloated.<br />  Camera:  The phone camera on this is great! Not quite Pixel level, but as this phone can be had for 2/3 the price of a pixel (I picked mine up for 500 flat brand new) I think it takes the cake in it's price range.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Stock Speaker:  The speaker on this isn't so great. It works, dont get me wrong, but it's not something to write home about.<br />  Moto Mods:  As I said above, some of the Moto Mods are great, like the battery and the speaker, others are not so great.  The projector's resolution and brightness are pitiful, and the Hasselblad camera mod is WORSE than the camera ON THE PHONE. WHY?<br />  Battery Life:  Without the battery moto mod, the battery on this phone barely will last a day.  Under heavier normal use I will barely make it to 5 pm (on time at 8 am), and under heavy use it'll make it till about 2 pm.  The update to Nougat (due in February 2017) will evidently extend this life by about an hour, so that's something.  However, with the battery moto mod the battery will last all day basically no matter what.  If you tried to extend the battery life with the mod you could probably stretch it to 2 days if you were REALLY nice to it.<br /><br />Other:<br />  Processor:  It's fine.  Just fine.  Not a real powerhouse, but for all your regular needs it does everything.  It does lag a little sometimes when I don't close anything and am navigating, playing music, logging driving over bluetooth, and get out to pump gas and play a game or something.  But you'll probably never notice any issues.<br />  RAM:  4 gb is fine.  But again nothing ridiculous anymore.<br /><br />I'd recommend this phone under the condition that you also buy the battery mod to make the battery life last all day.  I bought the wireless charging one because then I can charge the battery separate from the phone.",1,negative

This is the first phone that I have owned that does not support screen casting to a Roku.  My old Nexus 5 did as well as my Moto X Pure (2015).<br />2.  Small battery.  I know this is touted as the thinnest phone available, so it cost battery size in order to accommodate the thinner sideview.  Also, there is no wireless charging unless you add the extended battery mod.<br />3.  If you want to protect your phone with an armor case, then you cannot use a mod.<br />4.  No headphone jack.  It does come with an adapter to plug headphones into the Micro C charging port.  So, you cannot charge phone and use standard headphones simultaneously.<br />5.  No cable provided to link phone with PC.  You must purchase separately.<br />6.  Last but not least, support from Lenovo is deplorable.  The Retail US edition of the Moto Z as of now (Jan 17, 2017) still has not received the Android Nougat update.  In addition, this phone was released in October 2016 with the July 2016 security update, and as of today, still has not been updated.  Lenovo stated that updates were starting to roll out in November, but nothing in Retail US yet.  Calling support is of no help, they just tell you they are waiting for carrier review on an unlocked phone.  The Lenovo message boards are worse, with moderators instructing owners that they should have purchased a different phone if updates were important to them.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />1.

For the thin profile, the battery gives me a full day's use without needing to recharge.  I am sure this may change over time, but I had also heard that Android Nougat (7.0) was supposed to improve battery performance.  Not confident I will find out anytime soon if that is true.  As you may have read from other reviews, this unlocked version on AT&T has been largely ignored by Lenovo / Moto and possibly AT&T.  This is not a phone that AT&T carries, so I can't really fault them as much, but I would have certainly expected Lenovo to have upgraded the unlocked Moto Z by now.  The Verizon version was upgraded OTA around November last year.<br /><br />The notification problem has lead to me missing a couple of things, but in general it's not a showstopper.  I have seen far worse issues on Google Pixel and iPhone 7.  Overall, this is a very good phone all things considered, but I would definitely like to get the improvements that come with the Nougat update.

The unlocked Lenovo Moto Z was released back in September here in the United States. And also as of writing, this phone has never received an update since it was released. None. It is still on Android 6.0.1, and still on the July 2016 security patch. Not only does this make the phone horribly insecure in regards to malware and other exploits, it has not received the Android 7.0 update. Bizzarely, Motorola/Lenovo has advertised that the phone has the Android 7.0 update since November, but it only takes a little Googling to find that the US unlocked model in particular, has received no updates in the 4 months since its release, and both Motorola and Lenovo support will give no time frame for when or if it might receive any. This is despite the fact that the Verizon ""Droid"" model has enjoyed fairly frequent updates and has had Android 7.0 for months. The India, China, Europe, and Canada models also have been updated for a while now. But the unlocked US version? Absolutely nothing.<br /><br />It's a shame too, because the phone is nice. Good screen, nice build, fast performance, insanely thin, and 64GB + microSD is a great for those who like to download lots of apps, games, and movies. But Lenovo has completely and utterly ignored this phone in regards to support. There are many far better options out there for even cheaper prices.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well as of February 10, 2017, the phone has officially been updated to Android 7.0. Great, right? Well, not entirely. While I am happy to have Nougat, the unlocked Moto Z received an old version of the update, complete with a 3 month old security patch (Nov 2016) and without any of the bug improvements that the Droid models received. For example, in Android 7.0 there is a bug that lowers the volume of your notifications, making it difficult to hear. The Droid models received an update fixing that in late January, and have received a security patch update since then as well. The unlocked Moto Z, despite being updated later than that, received an older, less secure, bugged update.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we at least got Nougat. But my previous point still stands. If you value updates and after sale customer support (which you should), avoid Motorola and Lenovo. They care about one customer, and one customer only: Verizon Wireless.",3,negative

The 2nd phone has been excellent.<br /><br />Very fast, looks great, works great.  My only grip isn't with the phone, it is about not receiving the update yet to Nougat.  This is an unlocked phone and you'd think it would receive the update sooner than the carriers.<br /><br />As for people complaining about battery life...get a life.  Unless you sit around playing games all day long, battery life is not an issue.  The lowest I've seen the phone drop to on normal use is from a full charge to 30%.  With the turbo charger, it only takes about 30% to bring it up to 80% and in an hour, it is at full charge.  Pretty simple.  My wife and daughters all have iPhones 6 and their phones have nothing on the Z.<br /><br />Purchased a protective cover at a Verizon store which fits it perfectly and makes the phone easier to handle (maybe too thin without a cover).

It was a step down in utility, for me, as my primary concern as a product offering was ruggedness-and not just screen ruggedness.  (There just are not any out there since the Casio Commando.)  It feels to me very flimsy, as do all the big screen phones, & due to its thinness & larger size it is awkward to hold on to, with gloves, even with a case-as again-are all of the large screen ""thinner is better"" leaning phones.  I put better than a 1 inch scratch the screen the first day I had it-(Tough it is not.) it was in my pocket, with my keys-oh well-(This never never happened with the commando& I had it for over 5 years-but lesson learned.<br /><br />Seriously, for a $700.00 phone-this lack of durability is weak-really pretty crappy-(I mean, this isn't supposed to be an apple phone-the wife went through 3 apple phones in the time that I had my commando).  I then installed the recommended & over priced glass screen protector-which of course, -(yeah, it certainly is glass) cracked when the phone was dropped on its edge.  I will never buy a glass screen protector again).<br /><br />For people who use the phone as a phone, and I do-the battery life is AWESOME, at least for me.  I routinely get a day and a half out of it, before battery charge gets down into low 'teens.  The camera is more than adequate for photos-(PS-if the resolution is disappointing-get over it-it is a phone that has a camera feature, it is NOT a camera-but for the price...).  Of course, I don't play the games, or stream videos, or surf the web much-of which this phone will do, so that likely explains my battery life.<br /><br />I have the hot spot option, which is a necessary evil for me.  I cannot complain about that either, it is great too.  Even with two bars of signal strength, Ookla speed test shows a 24 gig download speed-much better than what I pay for at home, and cheaper too<br /><br />All in all, it stops short of being a ""great"" phone for me, as it is to delicate, as they all are these days, seemingly.  It does have the obligatory bloat wear, and for the price of the phone, that should be easy to get rid of by deletion, but not so.<br /><br />And that brings me to my sole complaint on the phone.  The price is absurdly expensive.  As they all are.  But, flip phone days are over, aren't they.",4,positive

B079YM4RXS,"on December 13, 2016",amzn1.account.AERV5KUGO64QIPICGTJCNOY5SGPQ,"If you want to use Bluetooth for ANYTHING, do not buy this phone","One last update.  If I could give this 0 starts I would...especially after using my Galaxy S8+.  My smart watch no longer disconnects randomly. I can sync my MISFIT without power cycling the phone, and I can make and receive calls in my car reliably.  The Moto Z Bluetooth performance is truly awful and ruins the entire experience.  Didn't they used to talk about Seemless Mobility?  My final jab at this crappy product will be that as I was driving back from FedEx with my Galaxy S8+ I made one last call with my Moto Z to check on my mom and her chemo session earlier that day.  No kidding, it dropped the connection three times, which was just perfect to make my mom repeat what she was saying three times.<br /><br />Sadly, I am editing my review and lowering to 1 star.  I ended up returning the phone through Motorola as I had missed my window with Amazon.  I have to say the return process was completely painless, and I had a brand new phone in less than a week.<br /><br />That's where the good news ends.  After a month, I think the Bluetooth performance on this one might even be worse.  I can't tell you how frustrating it is to not be able to make or receive a phone call in my car with any confidence that the audio will route properly.  This is a basic feature I've expected from bargain basement phones for the past 10+ years.  A premium flagship phone has to cover the basics.<br /><br />To make matters worse, I recently won a fitness tracker.  It synchs with the phone via Bluetooth.  Lo and behold, it has problems connecting often, and the only solution is to power cycle the phone.  Even after that, the phone shows that Bluetooth is on, but the app says it's off, and asks for permission to turn it on.  I allow that, and magically Bluetooth works again.<br /><br />To sum up, if you plan on using Bluetooth devices, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!<br /><br />The Bluetooth performance on this phone drops it from great to a disaster.  I've had 30 phones or so connected to my car's Bluetooth.  I've never had one perform as badly as this one.  Every call I make, I have to hit the speaker button and select Bluetooth.  Not what you want to be doing when driving.  In essence, I can only make calls when stopped.  (android auto makes it slightly easier, but still far from safe)  For incoming calls, sometimes they route to Bluetooth, often they don't.  Then, in the call, the bluetooth connection often drops mid call.  I have to pick up the phone and talk into it...which is illegal in Illinois, so I just shout that I'll call back when safe or ask them to hold on for a bit as the Bluetooth will eventually reconnect.  This is a major major disappointment in what is supposed to be a premium flagship phone.<br /><br />To be fair...all else is actually pretty great.  It feels good in my hand, and I use the camera, extended battery, and car mount mods. (the BT problems started before the car mount...so not related)  With 4GB of RAM it is very responsive, and the battery life is outstanding.<br /><br />Like everything though, one major issue has killed my love for this phone. As much as I commute, I need to be able to reliably make and receive calls while driving, and this does not accomplish this basic need.",1,negative

B079YM4RXS,"on December 6, 2016",amzn1.account.AFEQ7KMN54VI73AK2XHKXOPGMNSQ,Almost perfect,"Ive been a Motorola owner since the original Moto X in 2013. I switched from the Galaxy S3 because the X offered features I really cared about, not useless gimmicks. The Moto Z thankfully continues that idea with legitimately innovative mods.<br /><br />First the design; whenever I first see a new Moto phone, I think, My God thats ugly! Why would they change what works? But then I actually start using the phone and that opinion changes. The Moto Z is (in my opinion) one of the most beautiful smartphones ever made, right up there with the iPhone 4 and HTC One M7. The glass and aluminum feels just as good as the Galaxy S6 and the style shells you can get for it provide that customization Motorola is famous for. However, I must admit, I hate the way the front of the phone looks. The giant fingerprint sensor combined with huge top and bottom bezels with NO stereo speakers is a step back from something they've been doing since 2014. I really wish the fingerprint scanner could have been placed on the back or made smaller, anything.<br /><br />As for the rest of the hardware, there is unfortunately no headphone jack. I personally don't mind this since I use bluetooth, but its disappointing that its gone. The phone is crazy thin and that makes it feel unique without feeling fragile. (look up bend tests to see what I mean). The camera hump is huge and annoying, but putting a style shell fixes that. The screen is one of the best I've ever seen, only surpassed by the S7. I wish wireless charging came standard without Moto mods, but thats probably not a big deal for most people.<br /><br />The software is simply put, the best Android has ever been. (I haven't used the Pixel so I can't comment on that). As many others have said, This phone does Android better than Google and they're right. Features like Moto Display and Moto Voice have become things I've really got used to over the years, and the gestures like the quick camera launch should be on every phone. Its also super slick and responsive, as stock Android usually is, and its nice to already have Nougat.<br /><br />The camera is great by Motorola standards, good by all else. It takes a while to focus and tends to overexpose in certain scenes, and low light is just not on par with the iPhone 7 or S7. In well lit areas, it performs well, with my only issues being a little bit of over sharpening on edges and some digital noise. The camera software on the other hand is far better than previous Moto phones. There are more controls available with a manual mode included. 4K video is included, but I don't have a 4K screen so I just stick to 1080p, which can be shot either at 30FPS HDR or 60FPS regular. Slo-mo is included with 720P at 120FPS, which kinda sucks. The iPhone 7 can shoot at 240FPS and has time-lapse modes as well. I'm sure these can be added with updates, but there's no guarantee of that.<br /><br />The Moto Mods are a great idea, but a little expensive. I love the idea of being able to add functionality to the phone in a snap, but they really do require an investment. I bought a battery and the camera mods shortly after the phone, and they do come in handy. (I have full reviews of both products on my profile) Using the mods is dead simple. You snap them on the back and they instantly connect and react, it just works. Some fun ideas for Moto mods might be something that can dock your phone so you could use it like a computer, a game controller, or how about a solar charger on the back?<br /><br />Battery life is OK. If you aren't using it too heavily, you'll end the day with 10-15%. You won't get two days out of it, at least without Mods.<br /><br />Overall, Im happy with this phone. I wish it had a better camera and battery along with some design changes, but I cant deny how well it does other things. The mods perfectly integrated into the main experience and the software is quick and responsive with some fun features. Great job Moto.",5,positive

Without the pack it will routinely turn off with anywhere below 30% charge, especially if taking photos or watching video.

B079YM4RXS,"on December 2, 2016",amzn1.account.AGACK3XFLROFLTDIKYN2WK57SM6A,Great new phone to replace my aging Note 4,"After a day using the phone, I am very pleased.  Battery life is good for a day of heavy use.  Screen is AMAZINGLY crisp and bright.  Camera is good.  Call quality, as reported by folks I was talking to, is also very good/excellent.  I like the Moto actions (chop-chop to turn on flashlight, twist-twist to activate camera, even when screen is locked), but I am not a fan of the Google Now launcher, so I installed the Arrow launcher, and that is a big improvement.<br /><br />I wish the phone had heartbeat sensor like my Note 4 did, and I do miss the multiple apps on the screen that the Note had, but the thin, light nature of this phone certainly makes up for it.  Gaming performance is flawless for everything I have tried so far.  I will likely end up replacing the stock camera app as it's pretty basic.  But that's the advantage of almost pure stock Android, I get to choose what I want, and I don't have a bunch of junk I don't use hanging around unable to be removed.<br /><br />The magnet holding the backplate on is very secure, but I have not had any issues removing it.  The phone also came with a plastic bumper to protect the edges, but with that on, you can't access the SIM/SD card tray. (Phone uses nano-SIM, so I had to get a new one as the Note 4 uses a larger card)  I don't expect to need to go into that often once I get a new SD card, so that's not a big problem, but it's a bit annoying.  Another ergonomic thing I have to get used to is the placement of the side buttons for power and volume.  On my Note 4 the power button was on one side and the volume buttons on the other, but on the Moto Z they are all on the same side, with the power BELOW the volume buttons, which seems counter-intuitive.  The lack of the S-Pen won't affect me much, as I rarely ended up using that as it was.  Same goes for the headphone jack.  I haven't used a wired headset in over a year.  The Moto Z does come with a small adapter cable to allow you to convert the USB 3.1c port to a 1/8"" RCA jack, if you need one.<br /><br />Data speeds are as expected, using AT&T's LTE.  WiFi uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, Bluetooth and NFC both work well, as evidenced by the connection initiated during initial configuration.  I used the Google setup tool to copy settings from my Note 4 and all it took was a bump of the two devices.<br /><br />I haven't used the fingerprint reader, but others I know with the same model say it works great.<br /><br />Update:<br />I dropped the phone the other day, from a little lower than pants pocket height, onto blacktop in a parking lot.  The phone landed on the bottom corner (bumper was in place, thankfully) and while the bumper was scuffed, as was the Mophie battery mod I had installed, there was no significant damage to the phone.  The battery mod popped off, and I suspect the force needed to separate the magnets absorbed most of the impact.  The phone and mod are still both working fine.",5,positive

The back cover can be easily replaced or upgraded while the phone remains undamaged from normal wear and tear - at least to the back.

I walk around with my phone in my front pocket everyday at work using it for both business communications and technical issues encountered in R&D. I don't need a phablet as I have a proper computer on my desk. I need a top tier portable phone. The Apple iPhone 7 comes in 4.7"" and the Google Pixel in 5"" (in addition to their larger 5.5"" offerings). Moto, can you build a smaller version of the Moto Z for us?",4,positive

B079YM4RXS,"on November 12, 2016",amzn1.account.AGGCRTJ5GQWDD7AZYLY3L5AFFOAA,"Aside from the waterproof-ness of the Galaxy S7 / iPhone 7, I prefer this phone","I came to this phone from a Moto G first Gen. That phone had 3G, fast enough WiFi, a decent processor for the time, and a 4.5"" screen. I started to notice the slowdown a few months after I updated to Android 5.0, and then it really hit home when I tried to play Pokemon Go. I decided then that I would upgrade my phone when I had the money. I did a LOT of research, so I will try to highlight both what made me choose this phone over others and how it holds up.<br /><br />The processor: This phone has the second-fastest processor available these days, the Snapdragon 820. It does run very smoothly most of the time. Like any phone, it stutters in a very small number of circumstances. For this phone, the only time it slows down is when I start a new message to a person I've never texted before. Kind of obscure, I know. The phone is fast, except for these few times.<br /><br />The screen: I was worried I wouldn't want a phone that was this big (5.5"" screen, with a pretty small screen-to-body ratio). I was worried it wouldn't fit in my pocket. I was wrong. I like the big screen, and it fits just fine in my pocket. Plus, it's gorgeous, and about as high-definition as you could want. I've read reviews that say it's too reflective of a screen on a sunny day, but I disagree. I've also heard it's a fingerprint magnet, but I disagree. It attracts way fewer fingerprints than any other touchscreen I've used.<br /><br />The battery: I've read some bad things about this as well. It does not pack a very big battery, given that most phones pack at least a 3000 mA-hr battery these days. I can't say I'm overly impressed by it either. However, I purchased the Incipio Off-Grid Power Pack, the wireless charging version. With that spare battery on the back, it does two days of moderate use, no problem.<br /><br />The fingerprint reader: this thing is lightning fast. I've read good things about the Nexus phones having ultra-fast fingerprint readers, but I can't imagine it going much faster than this. It doesn't do the thing that Galaxy phones and iPhones do, where they first go to the home screen, think about it for a second, and then finally unlock the phone. It goes straight to your home screen. This doesn't seem like much of a difference (probably only about half a second faster), but think how many times you unlock your phone per day, per week, per year? The Moto Z is where it's at. Side note, though: the fingerprint reader sits on a rather large black ""chin"" on the front of the phone. This does look kind of weird, especially when the three black Android navigation buttons are present on the screen right above the reader.<br /><br />The camera: This is one area where the Moto Z loses to its competition. Both the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 have better cameras. I've also heard good things about the Pixel. The Moto Z has a good camera, don't get me wrong. But it's not the best. If you want examples of photos from its camera, there are lots of reviews online where they took the same picture at the same time with several different phones. I would suggest looking at those for the best comparison.<br /><br />The body: This phone is SLIM. Super slim. When I snap the battery mod on, the whole thing becomes normal-phone sized. So maybe you're thinking, ""yikes, is this phone going to snap in two in my pocket?"" I thought the same, and so I consulted Jerry Rig Everything, a Youtube channel. On the video for this phone, a very strong man (who was able to easily snap the Nexus 6P) tries to break it, and comments how strong it is. I was impressed. Another thing to consider about the body is that the camera is a very large bulge coming out of the back, unless you either attach a mod, or attach the back cover that comes with it. If you want it as thin as possible, you can take everything off. It's just that the camera will stick out like a sore thumb. It's really a stylistic choice for you to make.<br /><br />The headphone jack: Ok, I lied. There is no headphone jack. This is more of a problem than I would have thought before I bought it. They do include an adapter, and it actually produces good sound at a good volume, but if you lose it you're kind of out of luck. There really aren't any spare adapters on the market yet, not even from Motorola. The only ones you can get on Amazon are from Asia somewhere and have some pretty bad reviews. I think as the market catches on, some quality ones will come forward, but for now there are few options.<br /><br />The software: Lenovo (the makers of this Moto phone) does a really good job of leaving the Android experience very clean. The only things they add to it are (generally) helpful. Moto Voice is a female assistant much like Cortana or Siri, and it's useful but it has its quirks. Moto Actions let you turn on the camera or flashlight with specified hand movements; notices when you reach for your phone and lights up the screen; lets you put your phone in ""do not disturb"" by turning it over; and turns the phone's ringer to ""vibrate"" when you pick it up to answer. I turned off a couple of features, and you can turn any of them off if you want: the flashlight seems kind of dangerous, the way they have you shake the phone so hard. Also, there is a feature that allows you to shrink the screen to a smaller size by swiping up from the bottom; I didn't find this to be useful. Other than these features, there are no apps pre-installed on the phone. It's also unlocked for GSM, so you can use it on the two US carriers that use this technology, as well as in many places outside of the US. Be aware that you cannot use it on CDMA networks.<br /><br />Signal/battery issues: I get a good signal at home, but at work, inside the building at my desk, I get nothing whatsoever. The phone appears to search for a signal the whole day, and it causes the battery to drain rather quickly. While you could classify this as a network issue, I wish the phone would stop searching for a signal trying, or at least stop using so much power in searching so often, at least until the signal improves.<br /><br />The ""fast charging"": This phone really does charge fast, and the battery mod is no slouch either. Right now I'm charging it using the Moto charger that came with it, and it went from 22% to 65% in 30 minutes. Then it went up to 93% after a total of 53 minutes. However, all of the flagship phones come with fast charging these days, so it's not a stand-out feature. A side note is that this version of the Incipio battery mod includes wireless charging, but the phone itself doesn't come with it out of the box. On a $700 phone, this should be a standard feature (I'm looking at you, Apple).<br /><br />The memory: This phone has a respectable 4GB of RAM, and a solid 64GB of storage. It also has an SD card slot, which is helpful but I probably will never need it.<br /><br />The waterproof-ness: This phone is basically not waterproof. I think they list it as ""splashproof"", but it does not have a specific IPXX rating. If you want to drop it in the pool or go taking pictures out in a heavy rainstorm, this isn't likely to survive.<br /><br />The Mods: Moto Mods are pretty cool. I have both the battery and the speaker mods, which are both worth the money. I wouldn't buy the camera lens or the projector, because those are too expensive for what you get. I'm hopeful that Moto will continue to push for more Mods. If you have an idea for one, by the way, Motorola has development kits to speed you on your way; they want Mods to become a prolific thing!<br /><br />The price: This phone is priced the same as the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7, so it's clear they're targeting the same folks. When I got one, the clincher that put me over the edge is that they took $150 off of the price in order to undercut Samsung and Apple. It was a limited time offer, and it may not be available by the time you read this. I do believe that the $550 I paid was worth it. On a side note, the Galaxy S7 is coming available this Black Friday at Best Buy for the same price. However, I'm not too disappointed I chose Moto. The screen is bigger, the capabilities are expandable, and I've always liked Moto phones.<br /><br />The verdict: I like this phone. If it was priced at $550 all the time, I would give it five stars. At $700 it's too expensive for what you get. But hey, aren't the iPhone and the Galaxy the same way? In the end the choice is yours between this and the other flagships, but aside from the waterproof features of the S7 / iPhone 7, I prefer this phone.<br /><br />EDIT 11/29/16: After having this phone for almost a month, I wanted to add just one detail: the camera lens scratches WAY too easily. I can't keep my keys in the same pocket as my phone anymore. They don't scratch the screen even remotely, but they scratch the camera lens SO easily. Not a huge deal, but a letdown nonetheless. It doesn't change my rating, but it slightly sways the argument towards buying another flagship phone over this one.",4,positive
B079YM4RXS,"on November 5, 2016",amzn1.account.AGHFP6NOFIOPNUIFP2IINVXNSHBQ,It is a great phone. DO NOT BUY IT!!!,"Motorola/Lenovo is not prepared to support this phone in any way. Their Moto Care accident protection, which is advertised on the literature that comes with the phone, is still not available. If you purchase your phone directly from Motorola it is now available. However, for anyone that bought their phone before that was an option, it is still not available. So, and Amazon may correct me here, if you buy it from Amazon you'll have no way to purchase Moto Care. This is not in any way a knock against Amazon since it is not their fault. I don't even like writing this review here since I love Amazon, but I think everyone considering purchasing this phone should know about it. Maybe it will even force Motorola to work harder and fixing this. It took over two months to make Moto Care available to people at the time they purchase it.<br /><br />I continue to ask on their support forum for updates on when it will be available post-purchase and the only response I have seen is,<br /><br /> ""Moto Care is now available for Moto Z (non-Droid versions) at the time of device purchase. We're still working on post-sales purchase, but this is progress, anyway!""<br /><br />So, as far as I can tell by talking to customer service and on the forum, if I happen to break my phone I am stuck with the full repair bill or wait, with a broken phone, for Moto Care to become available. That is assuming they will still let me purchase it when/if it does become available. With the lack of customer service I have seen so far, I wouldn't be surprised if they tell me that I have had the phone for too long for Moto Care to be available for purchase. I have a reference number for when I called customer service about this, within 30 days of purchasing the phone, but if it takes two more months to get this fixed I will seriously doubt that the reference number will matter.<br /><br />Again, this is not Amazon's fault. In fact, I wish I would have purchased the phone through Amazon. Amazon's customer service has always been fantastic and they would probably do something to rectify the situation if someone was to break their phone before Moto Care is available, but there is no way to know for sure.<br /><br />So, don't buy this phone yet.",5,positive
B079YM4RXS,"on October 24, 2016",amzn1.account.AEJKURK7ZX2KSJIC57CTVIQ6JDHQ,Fun phone but with some big draw backs,This is a nice light weight/thin phone with really fun items to add on like a camera and speaker system. I purchased everything but the projector.  They even sell the large battery pack which snaps on the back to let you use the phone much longer without recharging. Since I had two note 7  phones which I had to return I was really excited about this system. They unlocked it so it works with my carrier T-Mobile.  Going out to the Washington coast this weekend I found out something about the phone which is a deal breaker for me and the impetus for this phone's return... T-Mobile had no coverage where I was staying. I signed on to the property's wifi...I could not use wifi for texting or for phone calls. When I called today to Motorola they said it was a carrier issue. When I called T-Mobile they said since it was not a phone they carry they do not support wifi calling or texting. Whhaatt? There are plenty of times when the network does not have good signal...been to Hawaii lately? I always feel pretty safe knowing I can duck into a wifi hotspot and get a connection or help if I need to. Not with this phone. Too bad. The idea of new mods etc was exciting to look forward to. There were other things that did not work as smooth as Samsung phones but I was willing to overlook them because this phone feels exciting and I looked forward to new add on mods. Amazon is a champ for letting me return it within the 30 day period. I will have to figure out what to do with the accessories I purchased through Verizon.,3,negative

A relative purchased the same phone through a different Seller (also, on Amazon), and he ran into the same issue.  If you want a Motorola-backed Warranty, be aware that you may not get it if there is a Seller other than Amazon involved.  Otherwise, the phone is a fantastic upgrade from my Moto X 2nd Gen.

At the moment, unless you want to have a battery mod on the phone 24/7, I do not recommend this phone.<br /><br />[Screen]: The screen on this phone is definitely one of the highlights of the phone. Its a nice size (5.5"") and has good viewing angles. Its a 1440p AMOLED screen and looks fantastic on the vibrant setting. Colors pop and text is very sharp. It does get pretty bright, but could still stand to be brighter as it is hard to see in direct sunlight. It also doesn't get very dim, so using it at night can be blinding.<br /><br />[Build and Design]: This is a well build phone, most Moto phones are. Although this is the thinnest smartphone ever, it feels rock solid. Probably the best built phone I've owned beside my old HTC One m7. The design, however, is where things fall short. Its a fine looking phone, but has some problems. First, the big one, no headphone jack. This is a trend that needs to stop. The headphone jack is not some old, out of date port. Its a headphone jack. No point removing it at all, not a single reason. Although having 2.5d glass looks and feels nice, it does expose more of the glass to damage when dropped. It also means that tempered glass screen protectors will have to be smaller than the screen. Although I love having a super thin phone, I don't think it is worth it which I'll explain later. Another problem is the screen to body ratio is not very good, this phone has huge chins. There's also a MOTO logo right on the front of the phone, which looks pretty tacky. The back metal is a pretty big fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />[Camera]: Its OK. Motorola is not known for not having great cameras, and this continues the trend. Pictures look good when in good lighting and after a bit of tweaking, but in any other light its pretty below average. It uses a pretty old sensor, the Sony IMX214, which was actually used in the Nexus 6 and OnePlus One. Video quality is pretty good though, especially the 4k HDR recording. Overall its enough to point and shoot type stuff, but if you really like using your phone for taking pictures, you'd be much better off with something else.<br /><br />[Connectivity]: I'm using this on AT&T and have also used it abroad too. Abroad it worked great, I was able to easily connect and switch networks and maintained LTE coverage the whole time. Back in the US, however, its a different story. Up until June everything worked fine. Since then, things have been different. Now, it is very rare that I will connect to LTE. Instead, it seems to default to H. Switching APNs, changing preferred network type, factory resetting, and updating the phone have not fixed this issue. Now I'm stuck on H.<br /><br />[Sound]: I love having a speaker on the front of the phone. Not as nice as having dual front speakers, but better than bottom speakers. The sound quality from the speaker is pretty good, but it doesn't get that loud. As for headphone output, its good and bad. It is nice and loud, which is nice as I've used some devices that are very quiet. The sound quality, unfortunately, isn't the best, probably because of not having a headphone jack. Audio through the USB C port is scaled down to 16bit quality instead of the standard 24bit audio. Audio is still pretty clear, but bass is lacking, even with EQ. About that EQ, the EQ is very limited. Its just a measly 5 band equalizer that you cant even customize, there's just a few presets you can choose. Once again, overall its just alright.<br /><br />[UI and Software]: The UI is fantastic. Moto has the best skin out there. Its pretty much stock android with a few great tweaks like moto approach, gestures, and customizing your OK Google phrase to anything you want. Because of all this this phone flies through the UI. Software updates is yet another blemish on this phone. They are very few and far between, with the model, the US unlocked variant, being to last to receive all updates for the most part. Moto has said that they will not be committing to the security updates, and that is one promise they have kept. I have only gotten 2 updates since I've had the phone, one for 7.0 and one for a security update. And, seeing how moto has treated some of their other phones, I wouldn't expect too many more updates for this phone.<br /><br />[Performance]: This is a very good performing phone. I believe it is the fastest SD820 phone there is. However, ever since the nougat update, I get a lot of stuttering sometimes and a few app frees and crashes, mainly settings and camera. Overall though, its still a great performing phone. It does get very hot. Even with light use (I don't really do any heavy use since I don't play games on my phone), it tends to warm up a lot, sometimes enough to even be uncomfortable to hold.<br /><br />[Battery]: Finally, we arrive at the battery. When I bought this phone, I didn't expect it have the best battery. I mean, it has a 2600mah battery. That's pretty laughable for any size phone nowadays. This is the thinnest smartphone ever made, so there has to be some tradeoff. Well, when I got the phone, I was actually amazed. I was easily making it through the whole day without needing to charge and was consistently getting over 6 hours of screen on time(SOT). This was way better than any phone I'd had before. I had a battery mod, but rarely needed to use it, mainly put it on when I was traveling or when I knew I would be away from a charger for longer than a day or so. This continued for a few months. Those were some good months. Then, I received the update to Android Nougat. From there, I immediately noticed a drop in battery (and yes, I did a clean install). I went from averaging 6+ hours SOT to about 5 hours SOT. Standby drain also increased. Not a huge decrease, but was still disappointing. Over the next few months, it has only gotten worse. Now, I average about 3 hours SOT and have a standby drain of almost 4% per hour. The phone also gets hot more often and according to AccuBattery, I only have 81% of my original 2600mah battery left, making it effectively a 2000mah battery, smaller than my HTC One m7 I had years ago. I haven't made it through the day without needing to charge in weeks. Its extremely frustrating and disappointing. The battery mod is required now, and I don't like that. The battery mod should be something that you use when you need to extra juice, not to make your phone usable .  Just based on this alone, I would stay away from this phone.<br /><br />[Moto Mods]: Moto mods are a really cool idea, and definitely the best implementation of modular smartphone technology. The execution is not quite as great. There isn't anything wrong with the mods really, except for the camera which actually has a worse sensor than the built in camera, its more the price. The style shells are priced fine, they're pretty cheap. The speaker mods are a bit expensive and a standalone Bluetooth speaker will definitely sound better but they are very convenient. The battery mods also shine with their convenience and ease of use compared to a standalone backup battery, but you do lose out on charge speed and capacity( you can get a 30000+mah backup battery for the price as the battery mod, which is 2220mah). I do think it is a good buy though if you can get one on sale or from ebay. Like I said above, the camera mod is way too expensive and worse than the stock camera except for the zoom. The projector is also really nice, but yet again you trade quality for convenience, soft of. I don't mean the build quality is bad, but for the same price you can get a much much better projector  that works with all your devices instead of just your phone. I also say you get more convenience because while it is more convenient as its attaches to your phone and just shows what's on the screen, you cant project a movie or anything and use your phone for something else. Overall, if the mods were all cheaper they'd be a great buy, and they still are, but you have to be really committed to the Moto ecosystem to justify the price of some of them.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Z series phone, this probably isn't for you. Go with the z play or the z2 play, they are just better phones.",2,negative
B079YM4RXS,"on July 27, 2017",amzn1.account.AFCLF3R7EPU2FTHXG6GBJUUATDQQ,Slick! Add a huge SD card with the savings you get buying at this price point.,"Best.Moto.phone.yet! If the luscious detail and color pop of the display doesn't grab you, the speed of operation may well do the trick! For example: this thing flies through updates. As an indicator; a 22M update for Google Docs will take approximately four to six seconds to perform. On the Moto X2 I upgraded from, the same install process for that single update would have lasted well over 20 seconds. To me this is a huge step forward in processing power. It takes AT&T LTE longer to download the updates than it takes the Moto Z to install them.<br /><br />The fingerprint detection is fantastic, once you go through the set up process. I chose to bind the phone's detection system with a finger from each of my hands, which is very helpful. The reader is really nimble, virtually instant, and the reader square is easy to find with one's fingertip in the dark. Like I said, the fingerprint reader is super responsive; more so than my recent vintage laptop's fingerprint reader. I think the verbal interface is beginning to shine, and gets most of my speech right. Commands spoken to the phone, initiated by a key phrase (default is ""Google Now"" to 'wake up' its ears, Example:  ""Google Now  set timer 8 minutes"". The phone will reply:  ""okay, starting timer 8 minutes."" I think the default wake-up is cheesy. I changed my wake-up phrase to something uniquely my own.<br /><br />For adventures in the power of this phone's features, run an Internet search for ""15 first things every Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid owner should do"" and read through what phandroid put together. The tenth point:  'Activate Googles secret menu and speed up your device' is one such gem. I would have never come across it otherwise.<br /><br />Speaking of update downloads. This is about when I first brought up the phone (after I took it to AT&T store to get the sim changed. Note: while I had the sim tray open I added the SanDisk Extreme 128GB microSDXC card I brought along from another Amazon purchase I made when ordering the phone. 192GB of storage with a fast quad core CPU - yes!! I reconfigured the camera app to use this storage instead of the phone's onboard.) The nitty gritty of first set up: there was a verrry long, drawn out series of mammoth updates to the initial build of the phone as shipped. First the screen prompted me to okay a system upgrade to version 7. (Android Nougat). Sure; why not. 1.5GB of download and one or more reboots later... then several rounds of Motorola's updates, totaling over 200M... and more reboots. Then Google joined the party to announce it had ANOTHER 250MB+ of updates, for apps. Well, better to have all this done up front than sometime later. I should add that you will also need a Wi-Fi connection for the phone during this procedure - because some of these updates won't run over the carrier, and the phone will tell you when you must connect to Wi-Fi in order to continue. Come to think of it, after all this updating I began to get a battery low indicator even though I had it connected to the charger. I found that by unplugging the cord and turning it over (USB-C is a symmetrically shaped plug) the phone suddenly woke up to 'charger connected'. Call me superstitious, but I put a sharpie marker dot on the top side of the plug so I would always plug it in that way, if it was a problem? Maybe I didn't have it pushed all the way in tight. That's just as possible. The metal plug should completely disappear into the phone port or it isn't securely connected.<br /><br />The charger I received with this Moto Z is considerably different than the charger that came with the Moto X2. For one, its now ""turbo"" (15-watt) which speeds up charging to three times faster than the Moto X. You can get a 40% charge in 25 minutes, or from 0-100% in about 80 minutes. The AC plug end of the charging cable is now quite large (2""H x 1.75""W x .875""D) and it is permanently attached to the cord. That means if you want/need a way to cable-connect your Moto Z to another computer you will need to purchase a separate cable: a USB type A to type C male-male.<br /><br />There's only one quirk (con?) I can think to point out about this phone. Perhaps it's related to or has something to do with the security posture? Security I enabled by activating its fingerprint reader, which also prompted me to establish an access pattern from an array of dots arranged on the screen like a touchtone phone key pad. (In fact, those dots ARE numbers on a touchtone key pad. Memorize what the number string associated with your saved access pattern equates to. I have read that there are certain instances where people have found themselves stranded facing a password prompt they didn't know they had input. However, they did - as a pattern! which is numerical under the hood.) Anyway, to the point of my gripe:  when I power on the phone after shut down, it boots up with a spiel of graphics, then screen prompts me for the access pattern I set the phone to, and then it boots all over again! Some research indicates that this is because the first time is to access Android and the 2nd time is to access the desktop. However, it seems to me this process could be streamlined not to look like two complete boot ups. I have gotten over the much-lamented lack of a 3.5mm audio plug - for which the phone comes packaged with an 5"" long adapter/dongle which converts the phone's type C USB port into a 3.5mm stereo audio jack for wired headphones or speakers.",5,positive

B079YM4RXS,"on July 5, 2017",amzn1.account.AEKRICJUQKU65AMQVVODFW7FTLIA,Nice phone.  Solid.  Bad glass front (break),"I've had this phone now for about a year.  The Off the Grid batteries are good (I have 3).  The phone uses the battery FAST.  as far as LONG life...unused, sitting on the desk, it will go about 24-26 hours. WITH THE OFF GRID power pak.<br />I like the wireless charging capabilities.  I wish Motorola SOLD the wireless charger as it took me FOREVER to find out wireless chargers will all charge this phone, you don't need a special one.<br /><br />I had issues in the beginning with the wireless charging batteries...(I was sent wired charging battery and didn't know it)....it took SOME MAJOR effort to get Motorola to even talk to me....service is not their forte.  BUT eventually they DID FIX IT.<br /><br />The glass front is GUARANTEED TO BREAK!  The side bumper will help IF the phone is tapped straight on the side.  But the glass of anyone I know (5) has broken for ALL within a month or two.  Motorola needs to help that out a bit.<br /><br />THE MODS ARE AWESOME.  I have the off the grid power paks and although I don't get the ""OFF GRID"" ability with just one....I'd need 1 PER 24 hour period.  I love them.  Easier than finding an outlet somewhere.",3,negative

When I first got it, I loved it.  It was running Marshmallow and every feature worked - including tethering (on Cricket).  Soon after I updated the OS to Nougat and then there were two or three more security updates immediately after that.  Once I applied all of these updates tethering no longer worked.  The phone started checking with carrier as to whether my phone was authorized for tethering.  This is unacceptable on an unlocked non-carrier branded device.  Its my phone, my plan - I should be able to use it as I please without it going behind my back to check with carrier as to what features my plan included.<br />In the 10 days I had it - it was probably the best phone I ever owned.  Lighting fast (WAAAAAY faster than my S7 edge).  But Motorolas decision to start checking with the carrier about tethering totally ruined it.<br /><br />I returned it for a full refund.",2,negative
