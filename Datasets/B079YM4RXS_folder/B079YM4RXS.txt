[t]Tale of Two Phones
##this is my second moto z.  i purchased one last year, and really like it.
##overall, it is a solid phone.
##my biggest issue is with the ridiculous desire by lenovo/motorola to make this the "thinnest" phone for some reason.
##this results in a product with limited battery life.
##i wanted a wireless charging phone, and with the wireless charging back shell, this works well.
##after going this route, i decided to find one of the wireless charging battery pack moto mods, which are out there, but not as readily available as some of the other novelty mods.
##the design of the phone, with the desire to have either a wireless or wireless/battery mod mounted all of the time severely limits protection choices.
##the only comfortable choice i could locate was the incipio bumper case.
##but you'll need to make sure you get the right one.
##the moto z, moto z play and moto z force all have different phone dimensions (thicknesses) resulting in a spat of bad reviews for this case (i.e.
##phone falls out of case).
##one of the reasons i have gravitated to the lenovo/motorola phones was the limited modifications to the stock android platform.
##unfortunately, one of my previous purchases after the early moto g phones, was a moto x pure edition........which was supposed to see quicker updates.
##not even close.
##my first moto z though already received the oreo update two weeks ago.
##unfortunately, that was about the same time my phone took a tumble and cracked the corner of the glass screen.
##i decided to replace this phone with another moto z, so i bought my second one and received it yesterday.
##i always try to purchase items on amazon that are actually "fulfilled by amazon", regardless of the seller.
##this usually means that i get what i ordered.
##in setting it up and loading the updates, i realized that something was "off."
##after looking at the phone details, i realized that what i received was not a us edition (software channel = retus).
##instead, i received an asion pacific variant (software channel = retapac).
##this meant that the oreo update my previous moto z got did not come through on this phone.
##i requested a call from amazon technical support.
##the customer service rep was very pleasant, but had to arrange a return of this phone, as it is not the us retail version as advertised.
##in addition, i'm not going to purchase another and gamble on having to return that one.
##overall, i like the power and overall performance of the moto z, but i'm not sure making this purchase on amazon is the best choice anymore.
[t]Perfect gift for the wife !
##the wife loves it..thankfully found a good phone after trying so many other unknown brands..
[t]battery sucks for this model.
##horrible.
##if there was a moto/android phone that would turn me away from this line it would be this one.
##the battery is horrible!
##the camera for some reason keeps rebooting it!
##battery wont hold.
##you literally have to walk around w/ a damn portable battery to be able to even use this thing.
[t]Four Stars
##camara is blurry when zooming speaker sounds bad when it's very loud
[t]NO WARRANTY!!! NOT AUTHORIZED TO SELL MOTOROLA PHONES!!
##really great phone just don't break it!
##it does not have a us warranty as advertised.
##motorola said they are not an authorized user to sell their phones!
##so if it breaks it is on you!!
##!
[t]I would have been better off buying the phone from Verizon
##it should be know that not all carriers can activate this phone.
##i have a verizon contract and have for 10yrs.
##verizon told me after hours of trying to jail break the phone,you that at&t  could turn it on.
##so know i have a contract for this phone through at&t (another headache), because i still have my tablet and another cell phone with verizon.
##in comparison to verizons retail price and the this price, i would have been better off buying the phone from verizon.
##it doesn't hold a charge despite the fact i bought the battery pack, has a crazy annoying start up screen and process.
##lesson learned.
[t]Great phone until the battery dies early
##as many others have stated, this phone is great to use initially.
##i've been a motorola customer back to the razr and atrix, and absolutely loved the 1st gen moto x.  the lightly skinned android experience with the added moto display, made this exactly what i wanted in my phone.
##at least until the battery died.
##every phone owner understands battery degradation, but this is beyond degradation.
##the phone is useless unless plugged into the wall or into a portable charger.
##even my moto mod battery pack is unable to keep it on without random shutdowns and the inability to power up without being plugged in.
##if you read the 100+ pages in the lenovo/motorola forum regarding the battery issue, it's surprising that nothing is being done to help the owners of this phone other than to recommend sending in for service.
##and since a good chunk of people are now outside of warranty, it'll cost you $150+ for replacement/repair.
##with this phone dying after 15 months of use, i couldn't convince myself that a replacement would get me much mileage, so the only solution is to look for a new phone that will not be a motorola.
[t]no useful information, I was tired of paying for iphones
##it shuts down whenever it wants to.
##lenovo does not seem to care, you can't even register the damn thing.
##you go to their chat room, and they just spin you back to another website that you have already been to, no useful information, i was tired of paying for iphones, so i thought i would try moto, needless to say i went back to iphone, at least there is some consistency
[t]Two Stars
##hi, i don't get a moto z but a g5.
##i want the difference to be refunded.
[t]Great phone for the price.
##i just received this phone (in rose-gold) as a gift from my daughter after my well-loved galaxy s5 finally bit the dust, never to rise again.
##have to say that i really like it.
##it's fast, capable, and the fingerprint sensor works sooo much better than my old phone did.
##the screen visibiity inside and out is slightly better than the old s5.
##both use amoled technology.
##it is large, but comfortable to hold.
##mine came with a wood-grain back cover, a bumper, data cord, separate power cord (was the euro-220v type, but had an adapter), headphones, 3.5mm to usb-c adapter for the headphones, and a small pick to open the sim-sd card drawer.
##the phone can accept either a second sim card or a micro-sd card, it uses nano-sim cards, fwiw..  which will mean that i can keep the other sim card in place for when i travel outside of the country,  with 64gb memory, and cloud storage, i'm not terribly worried about sd card storage.
##setup was a breeze, it auto-connected to both my google account and  to my service provider  so no huge setup was needed.,  when it arrived,, it had 83% charge.
##charging time is reasonable, but it is a battery hog.
##i have the moto-z mod for extra battery power arriving in a day or 2, which should take care of that problem for me.
##but so far, i've never dipped below about 30%, and i use the phone all of the time.
##the camera is fantastic, the included app is ok, but when i used the 'hd camera app', it was even better.
##this phone has been fast responsive and a pleasure to use; at this price, it's a great deal.
[t]Sound and Charging not working
##3 months after buying this phone i started having issues with charging and sound.
##all of the sudden it would stop charging and would turn mute to audio and calls i have to restart it in order to get those functions back.
##tried factory reset, but it did't help.
##now i'm contacting motorola customer support and would see if they would resolve the issue or return the phone!

##good phone.
[t]Buggy... buggy buggy buggy.
##the phone battery works good for texts.
##phone use is a pain in the ear.
##the phone has locked itself into speaker mode - people phone in the office and i answer and i used to get blasted with full speaker in the ear.
##i have since learned to adjust for this annoyance, but i shouldn't need to.
##then the hands free calling kind of sucks.
##it used to work ok, but after the "update", i now get the joy of having my car tell me there is an incoming call, and when i press the steering wheel button to answer it, the handset speaker is what i get to hear - not coming out of my car.
##again, i have learned to adjust for this annoyance, but i shouldn't need to.
##oh yeah, there was one time i found a serious bug in the accessibility menu, called talk back.
##if you have never used it, do not do turn it on!!!
##you will be locked out of your menu and you will be stuck in this alternate dimension where nothing you do will undo what you just did.
##the controls that used to work, no longer work.
##i found myself turning the phone on and off several times and pressing whatever buttons i could find to get back to the accessibility menu and turning it off.
##funny they would put such an option under the accessibility menu - it's like putting a sputter and quit button on the dash in your car.
##game play is out of the question unless i have a battery pack or charger nearby.
##access to the internet is amazing almost everywhere and i love the size, but these buggy issues have me regretting my decision to buy this phone.
[t]Bad joke from Lenovo
##bad joke from lenovo.
##after update 7.0  and some security updates, this phone is simple unusable.
##the battery drain in only 2-3 h to zerro!
##i can't use it during all working day without charging.
##i try some resets, clear cache partition, make an factory reset, nothing help.
##don't buy this bad joke from lenovo!
##the next bad side is camera lens.
##the camera's glass begins to scratch even after you get the phone out of the box!
##i don't know what an glass is it, mabe china made glass special from lenovo..
[t]Beautiful phone-okay battery
##great phone, beautiful screen, and works well.
##the battery is okay with the 7.0 update, can't wait to get the 7.1 update as well.
[t]MOTO Z is well worth the price
##still getting use to this amazing phone... fun in your hands and easy to use.
[t]Great value for money!
##got this from warehouse deals, best phone for the price i paid!
[t]Excellent Android phone. Great clean Android software.
##i love my moto z. i bought it to replace my older moto x pure.
##i was concerned about the small battery, but it has not been an issue for me.
##i keep an extra usb c cable lying around if i need some juice at work...etc, but it is rarely an issue.
##other than that, the hardware and the functionality is great.
##i'm very happy with the (nearly) stock android, and not the crap that samsung, htc, lg and others put on their phones.
##the hardware is great for me, very light weight, excellent screen, fast operating system.

##i always liked the old moto x machines so i decided to buy this phone.
##the phone is not bad, but the battery capacity is kind of sad.
##there is not much case option out there.
##the battery packs are so thick and you can't get any case to protect the entire phone.
##i also really dislike the 1 click dial feature of moto phones.
##there is only 1 speaker, so not loud enough.
##the volume buttons are also super small.
[t]Embarassingly bad camera on the Moto Z
##as a phone, it does what you expect, but the camera is absolutely terrible.
##my previous phones were the iphone 6 plus and the nexus 6p, both of which had fantastic cameras.
##the z on the other hand, has muddy pictures, terrible colors, slow auto focus, and generally takes photos on par with what you'd expecet from smart phones 5+ years ago.
##on the plus side, the screen is decent, the cpu is fast, and they give you expandable memory with a micro sd slot.
[t]I love almost everything about this device
##i don't write too many reviews but on this product i will.
##i love almost everything about this device.
##i have been and android fan for a while and i even have an iphone 7 but this is definitely my daily driver.
##the amoled panel is amazing!
##it really pops just as much as any samsung super amoled panel i've seen.
##the front flash is amazing for selfies (if you're into that sort of thing).
##i don't mind not having a headphone jack because i have samsung gear iconx earphones and bluedio u (ufo) bluetooth headphones.i'm all in on the bluetooth future so the head phone jack doesn't actually bother me.
##the moto z is incredibly well built and the thinness of the device is amazing.
##i marvel at it's design every time i pick it up to perform a task.
##the os is the google now launcher, so if you've used that before you'll love the simplicity and snappiness of the os.
##the little tweaks, like chop twice for flashlight and twist to launch the camera are bonus's that make this phone even better.
##it is able to upgrade to 7.0 out the box so you'll have almost the latest android (7.1.1 is the latest)  the one con is the battery life.
##because the device is 5 mm thin, it has less than the 3000 mah i think you need to run a snapdragon 820 with a 1440p 5.5" display.
##the battery life is subpar if you are a powerhouse multi tasker and multimedia user.
##but thanks to the included turbo charger and qualcomm quickcharge 3.0 this phone gets back to a %100 in no time!

[t]LENOVO HAS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!
##i purchased the moto z "force" version of this phone which is supposed to have an indestructible screen.
##i wouldn't rank this screen above any other manufacturers flagship phone screen.
##i dropped my phone while going to put it back into my pocket, the screen stopped working and lenovo won't back their product.
##customer service informed me the phone has a warranty on the screen, however, i will still have to buy the replacement parts...
##what????
##stick with lg, samsung or apple
[t]It is like it dropped down once
##when i bought cellphone in warehouse deal it shows pristine package.
##package was opened, charger was used and phone has a scratch as a kneaded.
##it is like it dropped down once.
##i am disappointed because already buy a lot here and never saw this kind of thing

##don't know if it's a defect so am pondering returning it.
[t]Quality smartphone, fair battery life.
##just got the phone through verizon.
##i had no trouble with the updates as some of the one star reviewers.
##i'm more concerned with the performance of the phone.
##the phone performs flawlessly.
##the 21 megapixel rear camera produces great images.
##i'm a professional photographer /videographer and i am impressed.
##the moto z runs all of my apps with ease.
##so far, no freezes, no crashes.
##this is more important to me than the latest os.
##i just upgraded to the moto z from the galaxy note 2!
##i haven't bought any of the mods, but i might be interested in the battery mod.
##i give the moto z only 4 stars because of the battery life, but the turbo charger recharges the phone with lightning speed.
##if you're looking for a new smartphone, i recommend the moto z. just make sure you get it through your cellular carrier.

[t]This phone is a beast.
##the phone itself is amazing.
##super fast,  thin,  and modular accessories make it the best phone.
##it is severely underrated.
##i wish motorola had better support for it though.
##and,  the software could use a few features like glove mode.
##otherwise,  it is an absolute beast.
[t]I bought this because Lenovo announced they were putting Nougat ...
##i bought this because lenovo announced they were putting nougat on these phones.
##they waited 3 months before pushing it to the unlocked us retail phones, basically making us the last to get it.
##there was basically no communication from lenovo on this and you can find many unhappy owners asking about it on reddit etc.
[t]Excellent On AT&T, Android 7 Update Live
##initial review: 2/16/2017  i will break this down as best as i can.
##to begin, i have at&t and am coming from a moto x pure and before that, an htc one m8.
##my moto x pure is still waiting for its android 7 update.
##and after reading some of the reviews on here i was worried that motorola just forgot about this device.
##however, as soon as i turned it on and logged on to my wifi, i received an update notification for android 7.  i set up my phone first, installed and customized a few apps, and then updated, which took 10 minutes of time and 6% of my battery life.
##so there you have it.
##the android 7 update is live on this device.
##the overall tactile feel of the phone is amazing.
##it comes with a wood magnetic backplate and a bumper cover which actually all look just fine when placed on the phone.
##i still ordered a new case...protection!
##you also get the usual manuals, a charger, and a small utility to pop open the sim/memory card slot.
##also included is a usb-c to headphone plug adapter, which is nice, but it should have a charge port built into that adapter as when it's plugged in, you cannot charge the phone.
##the phone looks great as well.
##i find the design very pleasing, although the bottom bezel protrudes a bit too far down and the camera kind of feels like i've got a rock stuck to the back of the phone lol.
##but these are things that don't bother me.
##what slightly bothers me is the removal of the headphone jack.
##i use bluetooth headphones so i don't have a problem here, but it might be a major problem to others.
##and i strongly disagree with the decision by phone manufacturers to remove it.
##screen:.
##gorgeous screen.
##i believe it's an amoled screen so go figure.
##it has deep black levels and the viewing angles are good.
##and it's actually quite bright.
##i wasn't expecting that; my last phone with an amoled was my galaxy s4 and that screen at its brightest was about 1/3 of the brightness of this.
##i tested it in the sun today and at higher brightness levels, it is easily readable in sunlight.
##comparing this screen to the one on the moto x pure, i'd honestly have to give it to the x pure.
##things are just ever-so slightly sharper, and i feel the colors are more accurate.
##connectivity: i get about the same signal strength on gsm/lte as i did with my x pure, which was better than my htc m8.
##wifi is really fast, bluetooth works well, etc.
##everything here works just about as good as one would expect, at least on at&t.
##ui: the ui is superb.
##it's clean, simple, and extremely fast.
##this is where the phone makes its night and day difference to me.
##it is ridiculously faster than my moto x pure in almost every way: opening apps, browsing the web, general usage.
##i'll also include bloatware here.
##no carrier bloatware which is amazing and there isn't much preloaded to begin with.
##it's pretty clean.
##sound: not as loud as my moto x pure or my htc m8.
##both of those phones have dual front-firing speakers which make watching videos or listening to music a very pleasant experience.
##sound quality from the speaker is also pretty average.
##i feel motorola could have done a little more work here.
##i've got the call volume maxed and i have very good hearing, but i still find it needs more of a boost.
##battery life: the jury is still out but it feels pretty close to my x pure right now.
##that phone has a 3000mah battery compared to 2600mah on the z. i will update this as i get more information.
##camera: eh.
##so the camera on my moto x pure is over 20 mp (4:3), 16 mp (16:9).
##the camera on the z is about 10 mp (16:9).
##i have yet to take pictures and compare the two but on paper, the camera on the x may best the camera on the z - will update.
[t]the picture quality is great, the built in speaker goes to a reasonable ...
##appearance - it is slim, light weight, and big.
##the screen is 5.5" but the surface area of the phone is bigger than other phones with the same size screen.
##i personally would rather the phone be a bit thicker if that would mean it wouldn't be as long.
##performance - so far it has been quick, the picture quality is great, the built in speaker goes to a reasonable volume (not as loud as i'd like though), comes with useful apps (spread sheet, slide show) why it's not 5 stars - i knew when buying it that it didn't have a built in headphone jack but i wish it did.
##i also can only find my photos that are being saved to my andriod account, if there is simply a phones gallery i can't find it without going through my andriod account.
##the charging port/cord is slightly different than the typical ones on phones now...this is a pro because it chargers to full in less then an hour and a half but the phone is so new that getting another cord for it is a challenge.
[t]Five Stars
##great product.
##big fan of motorola.
##battery a little on the light side though.
##get the battery mod.
[t]False advertising...Unlocked ver Not Daydream compatible and updates non-existent
##having owned a moto x, i was happy to take the plunge to their latest flagship.
##big mistake if you want reasonable updates.
##the unlocked version currently ships with android 6.0 on the july 2016 patch set.
##they have promised n but no dates given... and the phone is not daydream compatible without it.
##the camera is mediocre at best, slow focus and awful portrait pics with essentially nothing in focus.
##lenovo has clearly destroyed moto with the purchase so i would stay away
[t]Oustanding phone
##this is an amazing phone - i am most impressed by the 3 days of battery availability on a single charge.
##of course, your own phone usage pattern will affect the amount of time it takes to discharge but, overall, motorola has taken the many lessons it learned from many of its products and rolled them up into this phone.
##the volume and power button placement takes a little time to get used to; particularly if you are migrating from the samsung or apple lines of products.
[t]Excellent phone, very fast
##excellent phone, very fast, the battery life is very good for the use i give to the phone, it last more than a day.
##the only complaint is that the notifications sounds is very low and lenovo didn't fix it yet.
[t]I played around with a few of those mods but frankly it really didn't seem like any were worth the hefty price
##i am a phone junkie and bought a used one of these just because i'm a big moto fan and have used their devices dating back to the original razr, moto q, droid, and the beloved moto x of 2013.  especially after the lenovo buyout, moto just seems lost in their product design path.
##they've gone crazy with large phones thinking the larger screen cures all ills while falling short in a lot of key areas.
##as for the moto z, first let me say that the build quality is rock solid!
##and it really is unbelieavably thin!!!
##but, it's a bit large in the hand..wish they would've just gone with a 5.2 screen (something they haven't done since moto x 2014).
##i played around with a few of those mods but frankly it really didn't seem like any were worth the hefty price.
##my biggest two gripes about this phone (other than the large size) are camera & battery life.
##i feel like the camera isn't even as good as the nexus 6p!
##in low light, the shutter takes a while and images have very heavy noise.
##it's definitely not on par with other 2016 flagships; when will motorola finally put a top of the line camera/imaging solution in a phone????
##the battery life is seriously inadequate..it's a real struggle to make it through a whole day of moderate use.
##i can understand they had to cut some corners to make it so thin but i wish instead they would've just included a 1080p screen to go a little easier on the battery life.
##i also feel like this phone unlike previous moto phones does not have as strong of a radio as other phones.
##my reception readily drops in the elevator while using my sony xperia x compact hangs on to a signal for the whole ride as did my old moto x 2014. keeping my fingers crossed for a smaller flagship with an improved camera and battery life out of motorola in 2017.
[t]Like it! Good price too!
##the mods make it unique.
##buying it online avoids the cell company pricing and bloatware you cannot remove.
##nice to go stock android and depart from samsung touchwiz which is unnecessary.

##great phone fast shipping
[t]Great smartphone! I love it.
##great smartphone!
##i love it.
##it's crazy thin and light, fast, smooth, and has a great display.
##the camera quality is great in daylight, but leaves much to be desired in low light (don't get me wrong though, it's far from being bad).
##i love the 1080p @ 60fps video recording.
##the fingerprint sensor is very fast and accurate.
##it has a single front facing speaker, but it's loud and clear.
##battery life is good for me, i consistently get over 4hrs sot.
##this device charges extremely fast, 0-100% in a little over an hour.
##i must say that i really love the mod ability concept (one of the main reasons i got this device).
##the only two mods i will be getting at the moment, however, are the jbl soundboost speaker mod and tumi battery pack.
##one major con though is that this device hasn't received a single os security update since launch (still running july 1st security patch), not to mention the android 7.0 nougat update which the droid versions and other country retail versions users have been enjoying for months now.
##i had to install it manually, which i shouldn't have to do, however, i will still give this device a 5 star review.
##it's disappointing that in 2017 manufacturers still don't understand how important os and security updates are to customers.
[t]Very, very nice!
##love the phone and mods.
##i have the extra battery, jbl speakers and the camera.
##i camera mod is awesome.
##when i travel i take my bluetooth bose speaker, a big digital camera.
##now i have all my mods stacked together about 3" high 6.5" long x 3" wide.
##great space savings and big time weight reduction.
##granted my really nice camera will do a much better job but this allows you to drastically improve functions of a cell phone on the fly and send you pic off right from your phone.
##the speaker is awesome and you get pretty good volume.
##would have give it 5* if they have a stronger battery inside the phone thus you should get the battery mod if you are a high user.. also i bought one for my wife so we can share the mods if she is traveling and i am not......
[t]Built in battery too small, add-on batter too large ...
##built in battery too small, add-on batter too large.

##excellent product, fails with battery and 5.5 inches display in my opinion.
##2017-11-24 update: motorola / lenovo worst phone ever, less than one year using it and the battery fails every day, it reaches up to 76 % and the phone turns off, i'm using it with the incipio battery moto mod that lets me keep using it, but the internal battery at this time is useless.

##it is currently 10:30 am and the battery has died.
##this is a problem.
##i will not buy another motorola product.
##i listed to 45 minutes of podcasts this morning over bluetooth, scrolled through facebook for probably a combined 25 minutes, and updated 6 apps.
##i am changing my rating to a 1 star (from a 3 star) as this is inexcusable on a phone that is less than a year old.
##do not buy this phone.
##update (7 months in, june 2017) battery life has become a problem.
##i have factory reset the phone twice to temporarily improve battery life and keep only a few extra apps at a time on the phone.
##i dont play games or anything else on the phone.
##yet, with the battery mod, the phone barely lasts all day.
##without the battery mod it wont even make it to 5pm.
##the processor has also become woefully inadequate.
##the phone gets really hot when trying to do pretty simple things, like open snapchat, or update 2 or 3 apps.
##the camera has also proven to be pretty bad.
##many of my pictures turn out blurry or generally poor quality vs my old note 4. anymore it's definitely worth the money to get a newer, nicer phone.
##or a cheaper phone that doesn't have quite as high of expectations.
##the moto z is a good phone overall, but lenovo could do better.
##i'll list some pros and cons and you can decide for yourself!
##original review: pros:   modularity: if this is something you're interested in, you can exchange the backs on the phone to different things such as a speaker, a battery  pack, a projector, or a fancier camera.
##most of these are in some way useful to some people.
##i highly recommend the battery back and the speaker.
##screen quality:  beautiful screen blows many premium phones out of the water.
##qhd does it's thing.
##build quality:  aluminum body, looks cool without any back on it at all (those gold pins though), and the moto mods fit very well.
##software:  motorola's "skin" over stock android is very minimal and keeps things simple, unlike samsung who tries really hard to make android look like their own thing and makes it bloated.
##camera:  the phone camera on this is great!
##not quite pixel level, but as this phone can be had for 2/3 the price of a pixel (i picked mine up for 500 flat brand new) i think it takes the cake in it's price range.
##cons:   stock speaker:  the speaker on this isn't so great.
##it works, dont get me wrong, but it's not something to write home about.
##moto mods:  as i said above, some of the moto mods are great, like the battery and the speaker, others are not so great.
##the projector's resolution and brightness are pitiful, and the hasselblad camera mod is worse than the camera on the phone.
##why?
##battery life:  without the battery moto mod, the battery on this phone barely will last a day.
##under heavier normal use i will barely make it to 5 pm (on time at 8 am), and under heavy use it'll make it till about 2 pm.
##the update to nougat (due in february 2017) will evidently extend this life by about an hour, so that's something.
##however, with the battery moto mod the battery will last all day basically no matter what.
##if you tried to extend the battery life with the mod you could probably stretch it to 2 days if you were really nice to it.
##other:   processor:  it's fine.
##just fine.
##not a real powerhouse, but for all your regular needs it does everything.
##it does lag a little sometimes when i don't close anything and am navigating, playing music, logging driving over bluetooth, and get out to pump gas and play a game or something.
##but you'll probably never notice any issues.
##ram:  4 gb is fine.
##but again nothing ridiculous anymore.
##i'd recommend this phone under the condition that you also buy the battery mod to make the battery life last all day.
##i bought the wireless charging one because then i can charge the battery separate from the phone.
[t]Not impressed
##i can not recommended this phone.
##the main camera is based on a 2 year old sensor and it performs way below the quality of current competition.
##battery life is less than spectacular and you'll be lucky to get through a day of moderate use.
##moto mods are cool for a week , after that you realize how cumbersome and incovieniant they really are , the projector is weak , the camera is slow in every way and larger than a nice pocket camera, and the speaker is the best of the lot but you would be better off with a stand alone option.
##you would be much better of with a oneplus 3 , zte axon 7 , or an honor 8 in my opinion.
[t]Unstopable ads and no access to nougat!
##i hate this phone!
##total junk!
##do not buy unless you want a phone that cannot get the new update and has ads that intrude every 5 minutes!
##even over navigation when i'm driving!
##i'm returning this nightmare and going back to iphone.
[t]If you want a flagship phone, look elsewhere.
##the phone itself is decent, but it has some huge flaws in very specific areas if you use them.
##1. this is the first phone that i have owned that does not support screen casting to a roku.
##my old nexus 5 did as well as my moto x pure (2015).
##2.  small battery.
##i know this is touted as the thinnest phone available, so it cost battery size in order to accommodate the thinner sideview.
##also, there is no wireless charging unless you add the extended battery mod.
##3.  if you want to protect your phone with an armor case, then you cannot use a mod.
##4.  no headphone jack.
##it does come with an adapter to plug headphones into the micro c charging port.
##so, you cannot charge phone and use standard headphones simultaneously.
##5.  no cable provided to link phone with pc.
##you must purchase separately.
##6.  last but not least, support from lenovo is deplorable.
##the retail us edition of the moto z as of now (jan 17, 2017) still has not received the android nougat update.
##in addition, this phone was released in october 2016 with the july 2016 security update, and as of today, still has not been updated.
##lenovo stated that updates were starting to roll out in november, but nothing in retail us yet.
##calling support is of no help, they just tell you they are waiting for carrier review on an unlocked phone.
##the lenovo message boards are worse, with moderators instructing owners that they should have purchased a different phone if updates were important to them.
##on the plus side: 1.  it does charge quickly.
##you need this if you do not have battery mod and you use your phone "more than average"
[t]Unlocked Moto Z has been neglected
##i've been a motorola fan with my last four phones.
##when it came time to buy a new one the moto z was my first choice.
##unfortunately what no one tells you and despite reading everywhere that it has android 7.0 and is daydream ready, it is not.
##the verizon version was updated months ago.
##the unlocked version has no sign of an update anytime soon, google some forums and see how mad the unlocked z owners are.
##we're still on a security patch that's more that 6 months old while the droid versions are going on their third 7.0 update.
##i'm pretty sure this phone has just slipped through the cracks and i get the sinking feeling we'll get nougat (the november update the droid z guys got) in a few months and that may be it for the life of the phone.
##now that it's become clear this phone will be a dud, i'm of course out of my return period.
##i recommend against buying this phone and i won't buy from motorola or lenovo ever again unless moto gets sold again to a company that actually cares a little about customers and not selling falsely advertised products.
[t]Five Stars
##perfect
[t]does not support miracast! also no android updates available.
##fyi, this device does not have the latest android update available, as promised on the moto z website.
##therefore it will not support google daydream as promised.
##also, this does not support miracast, despite what the instructions may suggest, so no streaming to roku boxes or smart tv's.
##.
##this is just weird as every android device i know of supports this.
##the physical phone itself is great, software and support - lacking.
[t]Love it
##love it
[t]he said it was great.
##this was a present for my grandson,he said it was great.
[t]Great phone
##awesome design and performance!
[t]Great item love it
##must say this is a great smartphone highly recommended
[t]Great phone overall, no visible support from Lenovo/Moto
##as a flagship android smartphone, i would give it 5 stars.
##for the thin profile, the battery gives me a full day's use without needing to recharge.
##i am sure this may change over time, but i had also heard that android nougat (7.0) was supposed to improve battery performance.
##not confident i will find out anytime soon if that is true.
##as you may have read from other reviews, this unlocked version on at&t has been largely ignored by lenovo / moto and possibly at&t.
##this is not a phone that at&t carries, so i can't really fault them as much, but i would have certainly expected lenovo to have upgraded the unlocked moto z by now.
##the verizon version was upgraded ota around november last year.
##the notification problem has lead to me missing a couple of things, but in general it's not a showstopper.
##i have seen far worse issues on google pixel and iphone 7.  overall, this is a very good phone all things considered, but i would definitely like to get the improvements that come with the nougat update.
##one of the main reasons i spent extra on an unlocked moto z was for the prompt updates and support.
##my mistake.
##i'll update the review if/when this changes.
[t]Beware: This phone does NOT receive updates
##as of writing, it is january 11, 2017. the unlocked lenovo moto z was released back in september here in the united states.
##and also as of writing, this phone has never received an update since it was released.
##none.
##it is still on android 6.0.1, and still on the july 2016 security patch.
##not only does this make the phone horribly insecure in regards to malware and other exploits, it has not received the android 7.0 update.
##bizzarely, motorola/lenovo has advertised that the phone has the android 7.0 update since november, but it only takes a little googling to find that the us unlocked model in particular, has received no updates in the 4 months since its release, and both motorola and lenovo support will give no time frame for when or if it might receive any.
##this is despite the fact that the verizon "droid" model has enjoyed fairly frequent updates and has had android 7.0 for months.
##the india, china, europe, and canada models also have been updated for a while now.
##but the unlocked us version?
##absolutely nothing.
##it's a shame too, because the phone is nice.
##good screen, nice build, fast performance, insanely thin, and 64gb + microsd is a great for those who like to download lots of apps, games, and movies.
##but lenovo has completely and utterly ignored this phone in regards to support.
##there are many far better options out there for even cheaper prices.
##update: well as of february 10, 2017, the phone has officially been updated to android 7.0. great, right?
##well, not entirely.
##while i am happy to have nougat, the unlocked moto z received an old version of the update, complete with a 3 month old security patch (nov 2016) and without any of the bug improvements that the droid models received.
##for example, in android 7.0 there is a bug that lowers the volume of your notifications, making it difficult to hear.
##the droid models received an update fixing that in late january, and have received a security patch update since then as well.
##the unlocked moto z, despite being updated later than that, received an older, less secure, bugged update.
##don't get me wrong, i'm glad we at least got nougat.
##but my previous point still stands.
##if you value updates and after sale customer support (which you should), avoid motorola and lenovo.
##they care about one customer, and one customer only: verizon wireless.
[t]Four Stars
##great phone but not working with verizon
[t]Five Stars
##good smartphone, has a good camera too
[t]It works wonderfully
##it is an awesome phone.
##and it works in chile.
[t]Four Stars
##camera glass is very very very delicate.
[t]Don't buy unlocked version. Bad support.
##i have bought six moto phones.
##this will be my last.
##it is a good phone but if you buy the unlocked gsm version you may not get updates.
##these phones are still on version 6 and the july security level.
##lenovo is not committing to deliver an update to android 7. they had promised it for dec 2016 and did not deliver.
##we don't have the security patches and the battery life on the moto z is less than a day on android 6.  also, i bought a number of the moto mods and they are problematic.
##the hasselblad camera is ok but not really much better picture quality as the stick camera, which is disappointing for what it costs.
##the jbl speaker is not loud.
##the incipio battery is great but can only charge when attached to the phone which is annoying.
##i did not buy the projector so i can't comment on that.
##the stock camera on the phone has a lag after you click the button to take the picture.
##this goes away in pro mode but i don't use pro mode, i just want to point and click.
##this camera is also not as good as what i had on the moto x v2, though it is better than the v1 (much).
##i would give this 2 stars except that i paid so much for it, it is a premium priced flagship phone that i bought six months ago and i can't get a software update!
[t]Stay away from it!
##i initially had a 5 star review however since the android 7.0 update nothing but issues.
##the most glaring is the bluetooth, wifi and nfc connectivity.
##there is not connectivity.
##comes in and out.
##very frustrating since motorola is of no help.
[t]Five Stars
##super phone better than any samsung i have owned
[t]Five Stars
##big improvement over our old s3
[t]Great phone!
##motorola by lenovo nailed this one.. i was concerned about the battery size, but lasts all day no problem.
##processing speed is great and display quality is awesome!
##the mods are fantastic!
##i have the projector and the car dock and will be getting the camera soon!
##get.
##this.
##phone.
[t]This is a good phone sharp graphics
##this is a good phone sharp graphics, the edges are over sensitive when i hold phone and different apps try to open, maybe my fingers and hands are to large, but i like the phone, it is very slippery and falls out of pocket easily also probably do to the larger dimension of the phone.
##doesn't make the phone bad just a new learning curve for me.
##life is good enjoy all the retraining you get with new and different technology.
[t]Great Phone
##great phone at a great price for $499, love the camera mod and wireless battery
[t]Wonderful phone. Screen is excellent
##wonderful phone.
##screen is excellent, performance is great, and battery life is much better than you'd expect from the relatively low 2600mah capacity battery.
##moto mods work very well - i've tried the jbl speaker and the incipio battery mods.
##i had both this phone and a pixel xl.
##i bought the moto z when it was on sale for $499.
##at that price, it is much better value than the minimum $869 for the pixel xl.
##were the prices equal, the pixel xl would have edged it out, however all said, i just *like* the moto z more than the pixel xl.
##the only dings i have against the moto z are as follows - 1) there's a stupid notification bug which motorola/lenovo know about but i haven't yet seen a fix.
##2) they've rolled out the android 7.x nougat update to the verizon droid editions of this phone, but the unlocked gsm edition is taking its sweet time and frankly it's getting frustrating.
[t]Not good enough.
##fingerprint reader doesn't respond.
[t]Awesome phone
##this is possibly the best smartphone i've ever had.
##i found it here on amazon $200 cheaper than on lenovo website.
[t]Incredible Phone!
##incredible phone!
##best on the market.
[t]One of the best phones I have used
##the moto z is by far one of the best phones that i've used in the last three to four years.
##coming from a galaxy note 5 i thought i was going to be disappointed.
##instead this phone has met every expectation it has very good battery life an excellent camera and the moto mods are an excellent add-on to get i definitely recommend this phone to anybody who wants to try something different and useful if you have any questions about the phone feel free to message me
[t]Two Stars
##something wrong with the camera
[t]Charger broken for Nothing
##the charger broken for nothing in a week.
##i have to buy a new one.
##that's why i just give 4 stars
[t]good experience.
##truly a.good experience.
[t]Outdated OS. No idea when I'll receive updates to the OS
##poor customer support.
##still has android 6.0. no straight answer from lenovo when i'll get 7.0.  same thing happened with.
##lenovo tablet.
##stay away from lenovo product.
##poor support.
[t]Nice phone, but shipped with Int'l charger, not compatible in US
##i received a 2nd moto z after returning the first for having the wrong power plug in (int'l version).
##the 2nd phone has been excellent.
##very fast, looks great, works great.
##my only grip isn't with the phone, it is about not receiving the update yet to nougat.
##this is an unlocked phone and you'd think it would receive the update sooner than the carriers.
##as for people complaining about battery life...get a life.
##unless you sit around playing games all day long, battery life is not an issue.
##the lowest i've seen the phone drop to on normal use is from a full charge to 30%.
##with the turbo charger, it only takes about 30% to bring it up to 80% and in an hour, it is at full charge.
##pretty simple.
##my wife and daughters all have iphones 6 and their phones have nothing on the z.  purchased a protective cover at a verizon store which fits it perfectly and makes the phone easier to handle (maybe too thin without a cover).
##phone is very strong for how thin it is.
##no bending issues at all.
[t]Wonderful product! Me and my husband love these phones ...
##wonderful product!
##me and my husband love these phones decent price for such a good product easy to use and no issues!
[t]Great phone. Love using the battery mod. Waiting for nougat update still...
##great phone.
##love using the battery mod!
##however my device still has not gotten the nougat update ota even though the update was released over a month ago.
##would give it more stars if the update would come!
##updated jan 1st: still no nougat update for this phone.
##motorola said it would be updated 4th quarter of 2016. lowering my review to 2 stars...  updated jan 15th: still no nougat ota update for this phone.
##phone is currently stuck with android 6.0.1 and july 1, 2016 security patch level.
##system update check shows the phone is currently up to date.
##lowering my rating to 1 star at this time.
##updated feb 13: just received the nougat update.
##no bugs noticed with it.
##rated back to 5 stars.
[t]I thought this version was the dual sim while it's ...
##i thought this version was the dual sim while it's not , its a sim and sd card version , this device is already with 64 gb memory and it's enough , i hope it was a dual sim card specially on this version ..
[t]Thin, fast, great battery life, so so, worth it.
##i love my moto z!
##i love everything about it., the almost stock os, the moto actions, excellent battery life, great call quality, easy bluetooth connecting, the thinness and lightness of it, how fast it is, everything.
##i had a note 4, which was great, really great, but i had lots of complaints about the carrier (at&t), their awful non-removable bloatware, slow lte, and so many other things.
##i dumped them and switched to republic wireless with this phone, and i am so very happy.
[t]Five Stars
##amazing phone.
##i got the projector mod which works perfectly and is a lot of fun in a reunion.

##no micro usb.
##no 3.5mm headset jack.
[t]Love it!
##i had been putting off getting a new phone for months even after my phone started acting up.
##well it finally got serious and the poor thing didn't have much time left & with my birthday around the corner i finally decided to look for a new phone.
##seriously right away my heart was set on this one, no questions about it, it's gorgeous, the mods!!!
##i had to have it, then come to find out that only verizon carried this phone :(  until, amazon to the rescue, i found this phone for $200 cheaper, unlocked for me(at&t) and as i imagined, amazing, beautiful!
##it works great, looks great & i couldn't be happier with my purchase!
##happy birthday to me :)
[t]Well, if this is the best they have...
##i have owned my droid for 3 or 4 months.
##it was a step down in utility, for me, as my primary concern as a product offering was ruggedness-and not just screen ruggedness.
##(there just are not any out there since the casio commando.)
##it feels to me very flimsy, as do all the big screen phones, & due to its thinness & larger size it is awkward to hold on to, with gloves, even with a case-as again-are all of the large screen "thinner is better" leaning phones.
##i put better than a 1 inch scratch the screen the first day i had it-(tough it is not.)
##it was in my pocket, with my keys-oh well-(this never never happened with the commando& i had it for over 5 years-but lesson learned.
##seriously, for a $700.00 phone-this lack of durability is weak-really pretty crappy-(i mean, this isn't supposed to be an apple phone-the wife went through 3 apple phones in the time that i had my commando).
##i then installed the recommended & over priced glass screen protector-which of course, -(yeah, it certainly is glass) cracked when the phone was dropped on its edge.
##i will never buy a glass screen protector again).
##for people who use the phone as a phone, and i do-the battery life is awesome, at least for me.
##i routinely get a day and a half out of it, before battery charge gets down into low 'teens.
##the camera is more than adequate for photos-(ps-if the resolution is disappointing-get over it-it is a phone that has a camera feature, it is not a camera-but for the price...).
##of course, i don't play the games, or stream videos, or surf the web much-of which this phone will do, so that likely explains my battery life.
##i have the hot spot option, which is a necessary evil for me.
##i cannot complain about that either, it is great too.
##even with two bars of signal strength, ookla speed test shows a 24 gig download speed-much better than what i pay for at home, and cheaper too  all in all, it stops short of being a "great" phone for me, as it is to delicate, as they all are these days, seemingly.
##it does have the obligatory bloat wear, and for the price of the phone, that should be easy to get rid of by deletion, but not so.
##and that brings me to my sole complaint on the phone.
##the price is absurdly expensive.
##as they all are.
##but, flip phone days are over, aren't they.
[t]Why the international model support dual-sim but the US model ...
##renew my review again, look my view before you buy this phone.
##i decided not return this phone and put some my personal view here: bed things: not a dual sim model as it in international one!
##battery die very fast , if you do not buy the battery mod.
##it's wifi is not very stable when i use it to watch youtube(my iphone6s did not have such situation).
##good things: cheap price for an android flagship phone.
##very fast recharge speed for battery.
##why the international model support dual-sim but the us model only has one?
##all website says it support dual-sim but it is not!
##i wait this phone for a week and now i try to return it after i got it 30 mins.
[t]Innovative phone at a great price!
##great phone, priced much better than the 32 gig model on the moto website.
##the mods and gestures are very intuitive and useful.
##do not buy the leather back, kind was rather flimsy, not fitting well.
##otherwise it's an awesome device priced almost $200 less than on the moto site!
[t]Timed Existence
##not a month after the year warranty is up and the battery is totally shot.
##other than that, it was a great phone while it lasted.
[t]Five Stars
##glad i brought it
[t]Five Stars
##it does more than my wife's i-phone
[t]I would never recommend this phone to anyone
##the phone doesn't even hold a charge.

##i would never recommend this phone to anyone!
[t]Couldn't be happier with the phone

##i love the phone.
##the only issue is that it keeps restarting.
##yesterday, it restarted twice.
##i decided to give this one back, and get the same phone hoping it won't restart.
##the size, the screen, how fast it works...up to now, makes it a great cell.
##it's beautiful.
##i got a stylish and resistant cover and it looks amazing.
##next month, i will buy the projector and i will let you know.
[t]This phone is BADASS 10/10 stars
##out of all the motos i've tried, this one is the best.
##my only issue is not having a headphone jack but that's minor compared to how amazing this phone is.
##my favorite phone i've ever owned.
##trumped the samsung j7 i previously had.
[t]I had the phone for almost six months now and ...
##i had the phone for almost six months now and the screen had started freezing.
##wish i hcad purchased the insurance.
[t]Screen bubbles
##i purchased one of these last year and had a bubble develop under the screen within 6 months.
##they replaced it as it was under warranty.
##the replacement developed a bubble under the screen within 6 months.
##motorola support must know this is a problem since the second offer of a replacement did not require a photo to verify.
##their support is ultimately clueless though.
##trying to get me to start the phone in safe mode to diagnose the problem which i had already explained and has nothing to do with the software.
[t]Good camera, terrible battery
##the camera on the phone is really nice, the device is a little larger and bulkier than the moto x that i had previously.
##however the most frustrating thing is that 1-2 weeks after the 1 year warranty ran out the battery stopped working almost entirely.
##sometimes you'd charge it to 100% and as soon as you unplugged it could drop to 15% and it generally just would not hold a charge.
##it's a nearly $200 fee to replace the battery once you pass the warranty.
[t]Motorola FTW
##i just love motorola phones!
##i've had blackberry, htc, samsung and nexus phones and none of them hold a candle to motorola.
##this thing is a battery powerhouse and super thin!
##love the size!
[t]If you want to use Bluetooth for ANYTHING, do not buy this phone
##one last update.
##if i could give this 0 starts i would...especially after using my galaxy s8+.
##my smart watch no longer disconnects randomly.
##i can sync my misfit without power cycling the phone, and i can make and receive calls in my car reliably.
##the moto z bluetooth performance is truly awful and ruins the entire experience.
##didn't they used to talk about seemless mobility?
##my final jab at this crappy product will be that as i was driving back from fedex with my galaxy s8+ i made one last call with my moto z to check on my mom and her chemo session earlier that day.
##no kidding, it dropped the connection three times, which was just perfect to make my mom repeat what she was saying three times.
##sadly, i am editing my review and lowering to 1 star.
##i ended up returning the phone through motorola as i had missed my window with amazon.
##i have to say the return process was completely painless, and i had a brand new phone in less than a week.
##that's where the good news ends.
##after a month, i think the bluetooth performance on this one might even be worse.
##i can't tell you how frustrating it is to not be able to make or receive a phone call in my car with any confidence that the audio will route properly.
##this is a basic feature i've expected from bargain basement phones for the past 10+ years.
##a premium flagship phone has to cover the basics.
##to make matters worse, i recently won a fitness tracker.
##it synchs with the phone via bluetooth.
##lo and behold, it has problems connecting often, and the only solution is to power cycle the phone.
##even after that, the phone shows that bluetooth is on, but the app says it's off, and asks for permission to turn it on.
##i allow that, and magically bluetooth works again.
##to sum up, if you plan on using bluetooth devices, do not buy this phone!
##the bluetooth performance on this phone drops it from great to a disaster.
##i've had 30 phones or so connected to my car's bluetooth.
##i've never had one perform as badly as this one.
##every call i make, i have to hit the speaker button and select bluetooth.
##not what you want to be doing when driving.
##in essence, i can only make calls when stopped.
##(android auto makes it slightly easier, but still far from safe)  for incoming calls, sometimes they route to bluetooth, often they don't.
##then, in the call, the bluetooth connection often drops mid call.
##i have to pick up the phone and talk into it...which is illegal in illinois, so i just shout that i'll call back when safe or ask them to hold on for a bit as the bluetooth will eventually reconnect.
##this is a major major disappointment in what is supposed to be a premium flagship phone.
##to be fair...all else is actually pretty great.
##it feels good in my hand, and i use the camera, extended battery, and car mount mods.
##(the bt problems started before the car mount...so not related)  with 4gb of ram it is very responsive, and the battery life is outstanding.
##like everything though, one major issue has killed my love for this phone.
##as much as i commute, i need to be able to reliably make and receive calls while driving, and this does not accomplish this basic need.
[t]this is the perfect phone. Flagship specs
##for me, this is the perfect phone.
##flagship specs, razor thin design, moto mod functionality, near stock android.
[t]Five Stars
##in loveee!
##!
[t]Best Android phone ever
##best android phone ever.
##moto did i'd right again by adding more gesture features , which no phones has.
##wish they make a smaller 4.7 version.
[t]Almost perfect
##ive been a motorola owner since the original moto x in 2013. i switched from the galaxy s3 because the x offered features i really cared about, not useless gimmicks.
##the moto z thankfully continues that idea with legitimately innovative mods.
##first the design; whenever i first see a new moto phone, i think, my god thats ugly!
##why would they change what works?
##but then i actually start using the phone and that opinion changes.
##the moto z is (in my opinion) one of the most beautiful smartphones ever made, right up there with the iphone 4 and htc one m7.
##the glass and aluminum feels just as good as the galaxy s6 and the style shells you can get for it provide that customization motorola is famous for.
##however, i must admit, i hate the way the front of the phone looks.
##the giant fingerprint sensor combined with huge top and bottom bezels with no stereo speakers is a step back from something they've been doing since 2014. i really wish the fingerprint scanner could have been placed on the back or made smaller, anything.
##as for the rest of the hardware, there is unfortunately no headphone jack.
##i personally don't mind this since i use bluetooth, but its disappointing that its gone.
##the phone is crazy thin and that makes it feel unique without feeling fragile.
##(look up bend tests to see what i mean).
##the camera hump is huge and annoying, but putting a style shell fixes that.
##the screen is one of the best i've ever seen, only surpassed by the s7.
##i wish wireless charging came standard without moto mods, but thats probably not a big deal for most people.
##the software is simply put, the best android has ever been.
##(i haven't used the pixel so i can't comment on that).
##as many others have said, this phone does android better than google and they're right.
##features like moto display and moto voice have become things i've really got used to over the years, and the gestures like the quick camera launch should be on every phone.
##its also super slick and responsive, as stock android usually is, and its nice to already have nougat.
##the camera is great by motorola standards, good by all else.
##it takes a while to focus and tends to overexpose in certain scenes, and low light is just not on par with the iphone 7 or s7.
##in well lit areas, it performs well, with my only issues being a little bit of over sharpening on edges and some digital noise.
##the camera software on the other hand is far better than previous moto phones.
##there are more controls available with a manual mode included.
##4k video is included, but i don't have a 4k screen so i just stick to 1080p, which can be shot either at 30fps hdr or 60fps regular.
##slo-mo is included with 720p at 120fps, which kinda sucks.
##the iphone 7 can shoot at 240fps and has time-lapse modes as well.
##i'm sure these can be added with updates, but there's no guarantee of that.
##the moto mods are a great idea, but a little expensive.
##i love the idea of being able to add functionality to the phone in a snap, but they really do require an investment.
##i bought a battery and the camera mods shortly after the phone, and they do come in handy.
##(i have full reviews of both products on my profile) using the mods is dead simple.
##you snap them on the back and they instantly connect and react, it just works.
##some fun ideas for moto mods might be something that can dock your phone so you could use it like a computer, a game controller, or how about a solar charger on the back?
##battery life is ok. if you aren't using it too heavily, you'll end the day with 10-15%.
##you won't get two days out of it, at least without mods.
##overall, im happy with this phone.
##i wish it had a better camera and battery along with some design changes, but i cant deny how well it does other things.
##the mods perfectly integrated into the main experience and the software is quick and responsive with some fun features.
##great job moto.
[t]Major power supply issues
##seems good so far but two major issues:  one, the speed charger they packed was not a usa model, even though i bought the us warranty phone.
##two, the audio has a significant hiss during phone call.
##people on the other end say i sound excellent, but it's pretty distracting.
##i'll update my review if these issues are resolved.
##update: 10 months later the usb-c charger stopped working with all cables.
##i bought an incipio wireless charger pack and have to give the phone and pack 2-3 full charges a day to get by.
##without the pack it will routinely turn off with anywhere below 30% charge, especially if taking photos or watching video.
##then i have to get it to at least 10% charge with the charger pack or it just bootloops on the wireless charger.
##probably the last moto product i buy for a very long time unless this is fixed.
[t]Great new phone to replace my aging Note 4
##after a day using the phone, i am very pleased.
##battery life is good for a day of heavy use.
##screen is amazingly crisp and bright.
##camera is good.
##call quality, as reported by folks i was talking to, is also very good/excellent.
##i like the moto actions (chop-chop to turn on flashlight, twist-twist to activate camera, even when screen is locked), but i am not a fan of the google now launcher, so i installed the arrow launcher, and that is a big improvement.
##i wish the phone had heartbeat sensor like my note 4 did, and i do miss the multiple apps on the screen that the note had, but the thin, light nature of this phone certainly makes up for it.
##gaming performance is flawless for everything i have tried so far.
##i will likely end up replacing the stock camera app as it's pretty basic.
##but that's the advantage of almost pure stock android, i get to choose what i want, and i don't have a bunch of junk i don't use hanging around unable to be removed.
##the magnet holding the backplate on is very secure, but i have not had any issues removing it.
##the phone also came with a plastic bumper to protect the edges, but with that on, you can't access the sim/sd card tray.
##(phone uses nano-sim, so i had to get a new one as the note 4 uses a larger card)  i don't expect to need to go into that often once i get a new sd card, so that's not a big problem, but it's a bit annoying.
##another ergonomic thing i have to get used to is the placement of the side buttons for power and volume.
##on my note 4 the power button was on one side and the volume buttons on the other, but on the moto z they are all on the same side, with the power below the volume buttons, which seems counter-intuitive.
##the lack of the s-pen won't affect me much, as i rarely ended up using that as it was.
##same goes for the headphone jack.
##i haven't used a wired headset in over a year.
##the moto z does come with a small adapter cable to allow you to convert the usb 3.1c port to a 1/8" rca jack, if you need one.
##data speeds are as expected, using at&t's lte.
##wifi uses both 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands, bluetooth and nfc both work well, as evidenced by the connection initiated during initial configuration.
##i used the google setup tool to copy settings from my note 4 and all it took was a bump of the two devices.
##i haven't used the fingerprint reader, but others i know with the same model say it works great.
##update: i dropped the phone the other day, from a little lower than pants pocket height, onto blacktop in a parking lot.
##the phone landed on the bottom corner (bumper was in place, thankfully) and while the bumper was scuffed, as was the mophie battery mod i had installed, there was no significant damage to the phone.
##the battery mod popped off, and i suspect the force needed to separate the magnets absorbed most of the impact.
##the phone and mod are still both working fine.
[t]Excellent device. Clean Android interface. Mods are nice to have.
##voice recognition and car modes work so much better than my iphone 6s which this replaced.
##battery life has been good, but drops noticeably when in a poor signal area.
##the moto mods are a great option.
##i love that the supplied back snaps on and takes all the abuse so that no case is required.
##the back cover can be easily replaced or upgraded while the phone remains undamaged from normal wear and tear - at least to the back.
##i do wish this unlocked version had the same camera (21 instead of 16 megapixels) as the verizon version.
##i despise verizon for using their size to force manufacturers to lock premium devices and features to that one network.
[t]Unlocked does not mean unlocked anymore. Not supported with ...
##unlocked does not mean unlocked anymore.
##not supported with verizon or sprint.
##must have been too hard to put that in the description.
[t]Great phone and mods
##great phone, love the mods.
[t]... * Battery life due to Lack of bloatware is great. * 5
##pros  * battery life due to lack of bloatware is great.
##* 5.5 screen with 64 gb storage a bargain at this price point * modular skins * screen resolution  cons  * camera slightly behind samsung in terms of sharpness and auto focus * cast function inoperable unless you have chromecast.
##using allcast third party app.
##* speaker is ok but not close to htc m10 or galaxy 6-7 models  solid 4 1/2 star phone ... not perfect but worthy of competing with htc, samsung and lg.
[t]Love my Moto Z!
##i've been using a moto z on at&t for a while now, and it's definitely my favorite phone.
##easy to set up, very intuitive to use, quick, great photos, love the moto features such as voice, notifications.
##i will never again own a phone where i cannot twist my wrist to take a photo or use chop-chop for flashlight on/off.
##love how it syncs with my watch, i that a great.
##i use it for tracking my steps / exercise, it's basically my laptop on the go, since i always need to be connected.
##have played with the mods a bit and love the projector and speakers, those are my favorites!
[t]This is a pretty cool phone
##this is a pretty cool phone, though i still prefer my original moto x design from 2013, which i am still using btw - i've had 3 of them.
##my biggest gripe with the moto z is that it is just too damn big.
##yeah it is nice and thin, but the overall dimensions are just huge and overkill for how i use the phone.
##there are a group of people out there like myself who prefer a 4.7" or 5" handset.
##i walk around with my phone in my front pocket everyday at work using it for both business communications and technical issues encountered in r&d.
##i don't need a phablet as i have a proper computer on my desk.
##i need a top tier portable phone.
##the apple iphone 7 comes in 4.7" and the google pixel in 5" (in addition to their larger 5.5" offerings).
##moto, can you build a smaller version of the moto z for us?
[t]It is really the breakthrough innovation of smart phone in 2016
##it is really the breakthrough innovation of smart phone in 2016. the mods lift all the limit that a smart phone can not do.
##such as amazing photo, audio and even portal projector.
[t]BEST PHONE IN THE WORLD AND BEYOND!
##i love this phone.
##there are so many apps and the battery life lasts so long that i kept playing on it for days.
##after a few days of constant use i died of dehydration.
##i call my family every night precisely at 3:13 a.m. from beyond the grave.
##the reception is great!!!
##i recommend this phone to any person living or dead.
[t]Stay away
##gave me problems from day 1 rebooting by itself during minimal activity.
##often got hot to the touch.
##at day 4 it died while i was browsing my facebook feed.
[t]Aside from the waterproof-ness of the Galaxy S7 / iPhone 7, I prefer this phone
##i came to this phone from a moto g first gen. that phone had 3g, fast enough wifi, a decent processor for the time, and a 4.5" screen.
##i started to notice the slowdown a few months after i updated to android 5.0, and then it really hit home when i tried to play pokemon go.
##i decided then that i would upgrade my phone when i had the money.
##i did a lot of research, so i will try to highlight both what made me choose this phone over others and how it holds up.
##the processor: this phone has the second-fastest processor available these days, the snapdragon 820. it does run very smoothly most of the time.
##like any phone, it stutters in a very small number of circumstances.
##for this phone, the only time it slows down is when i start a new message to a person i've never texted before.
##kind of obscure, i know.
##the phone is fast, except for these few times.
##the screen: i was worried i wouldn't want a phone that was this big (5.5" screen, with a pretty small screen-to-body ratio).
##i was worried it wouldn't fit in my pocket.
##i was wrong.
##i like the big screen, and it fits just fine in my pocket.
##plus, it's gorgeous, and about as high-definition as you could want.
##i've read reviews that say it's too reflective of a screen on a sunny day, but i disagree.
##i've also heard it's a fingerprint magnet, but i disagree.
##it attracts way fewer fingerprints than any other touchscreen i've used.
##the battery: i've read some bad things about this as well.
##it does not pack a very big battery, given that most phones pack at least a 3000 ma-hr battery these days.
##i can't say i'm overly impressed by it either.
##however, i purchased the incipio off-grid power pack, the wireless charging version.
##with that spare battery on the back, it does two days of moderate use, no problem.
##the fingerprint reader: this thing is lightning fast.
##i've read good things about the nexus phones having ultra-fast fingerprint readers, but i can't imagine it going much faster than this.
##it doesn't do the thing that galaxy phones and iphones do, where they first go to the home screen, think about it for a second, and then finally unlock the phone.
##it goes straight to your home screen.
##this doesn't seem like much of a difference (probably only about half a second faster), but think how many times you unlock your phone per day, per week, per year?
##the moto z is where it's at.
##side note, though: the fingerprint reader sits on a rather large black "chin" on the front of the phone.
##this does look kind of weird, especially when the three black android navigation buttons are present on the screen right above the reader.
##the camera: this is one area where the moto z loses to its competition.
##both the galaxy s7 and the iphone 7 have better cameras.
##i've also heard good things about the pixel.
##the moto z has a good camera, don't get me wrong.
##but it's not the best.
##if you want examples of photos from its camera, there are lots of reviews online where they took the same picture at the same time with several different phones.
##i would suggest looking at those for the best comparison.
##the body: this phone is slim.
##super slim.
##when i snap the battery mod on, the whole thing becomes normal-phone sized.
##so maybe you're thinking, "yikes, is this phone going to snap in two in my pocket?"
##i thought the same, and so i consulted jerry rig everything, a youtube channel.
##on the video for this phone, a very strong man (who was able to easily snap the nexus 6p) tries to break it, and comments how strong it is.
##i was impressed.
##another thing to consider about the body is that the camera is a very large bulge coming out of the back, unless you either attach a mod, or attach the back cover that comes with it.
##if you want it as thin as possible, you can take everything off.
##it's just that the camera will stick out like a sore thumb.
##it's really a stylistic choice for you to make.
##the headphone jack: ok, i lied.
##there is no headphone jack.
##this is more of a problem than i would have thought before i bought it.
##they do include an adapter, and it actually produces good sound at a good volume, but if you lose it you're kind of out of luck.
##there really aren't any spare adapters on the market yet, not even from motorola.
##the only ones you can get on amazon are from asia somewhere and have some pretty bad reviews.
##i think as the market catches on, some quality ones will come forward, but for now there are few options.
##the software: lenovo (the makers of this moto phone) does a really good job of leaving the android experience very clean.
##the only things they add to it are (generally) helpful.
##moto voice is a female assistant much like cortana or siri, and it's useful but it has its quirks.
##moto actions let you turn on the camera or flashlight with specified hand movements; notices when you reach for your phone and lights up the screen; lets you put your phone in "do not disturb" by turning it over; and turns the phone's ringer to "vibrate" when you pick it up to answer.
##i turned off a couple of features, and you can turn any of them off if you want: the flashlight seems kind of dangerous, the way they have you shake the phone so hard.
##also, there is a feature that allows you to shrink the screen to a smaller size by swiping up from the bottom; i didn't find this to be useful.
##other than these features, there are no apps pre-installed on the phone.
##it's also unlocked for gsm, so you can use it on the two us carriers that use this technology, as well as in many places outside of the us.
##be aware that you cannot use it on cdma networks.
##signal/battery issues: i get a good signal at home, but at work, inside the building at my desk, i get nothing whatsoever.
##the phone appears to search for a signal the whole day, and it causes the battery to drain rather quickly.
##while you could classify this as a network issue, i wish the phone would stop searching for a signal trying, or at least stop using so much power in searching so often, at least until the signal improves.
##the "fast charging": this phone really does charge fast, and the battery mod is no slouch either.
##right now i'm charging it using the moto charger that came with it, and it went from 22% to 65% in 30 minutes.
##then it went up to 93% after a total of 53 minutes.
##however, all of the flagship phones come with fast charging these days, so it's not a stand-out feature.
##a side note is that this version of the incipio battery mod includes wireless charging, but the phone itself doesn't come with it out of the box.
##on a $700 phone, this should be a standard feature (i'm looking at you, apple).
##the memory: this phone has a respectable 4gb of ram, and a solid 64gb of storage.
##it also has an sd card slot, which is helpful but i probably will never need it.
##the waterproof-ness: this phone is basically not waterproof.
##i think they list it as "splashproof", but it does not have a specific ipxx rating.
##if you want to drop it in the pool or go taking pictures out in a heavy rainstorm, this isn't likely to survive.
##the mods: moto mods are pretty cool.
##i have both the battery and the speaker mods, which are both worth the money.
##i wouldn't buy the camera lens or the projector, because those are too expensive for what you get.
##i'm hopeful that moto will continue to push for more mods.
##if you have an idea for one, by the way, motorola has development kits to speed you on your way; they want mods to become a prolific thing!
##the price: this phone is priced the same as the galaxy s7 and the iphone 7, so it's clear they're targeting the same folks.
##when i got one, the clincher that put me over the edge is that they took $150 off of the price in order to undercut samsung and apple.
##it was a limited time offer, and it may not be available by the time you read this.
##i do believe that the $550 i paid was worth it.
##on a side note, the galaxy s7 is coming available this black friday at best buy for the same price.
##however, i'm not too disappointed i chose moto.
##the screen is bigger, the capabilities are expandable, and i've always liked moto phones.
##the verdict: i like this phone.
##if it was priced at $550 all the time, i would give it five stars.
##at $700 it's too expensive for what you get.
##but hey, aren't the iphone and the galaxy the same way?
##in the end the choice is yours between this and the other flagships, but aside from the waterproof features of the s7 / iphone 7, i prefer this phone.
##edit 11/29/16: after having this phone for almost a month, i wanted to add just one detail: the camera lens scratches way too easily.
##i can't keep my keys in the same pocket as my phone anymore.
##they don't scratch the screen even remotely, but they scratch the camera lens so easily.
##not a huge deal, but a letdown nonetheless.
##it doesn't change my rating, but it slightly sways the argument towards buying another flagship phone over this one.
[t]It is a great phone. DO NOT BUY IT!!!
##motorola/lenovo is not prepared to support this phone in any way.
##their moto care accident protection, which is advertised on the literature that comes with the phone, is still not available.
##if you purchase your phone directly from motorola it is now available.
##however, for anyone that bought their phone before that was an option, it is still not available.
##so, and amazon may correct me here, if you buy it from amazon you'll have no way to purchase moto care.
##this is not in any way a knock against amazon since it is not their fault.
##i don't even like writing this review here since i love amazon, but i think everyone considering purchasing this phone should know about it.
##maybe it will even force motorola to work harder and fixing this.
##it took over two months to make moto care available to people at the time they purchase it.
##i continue to ask on their support forum for updates on when it will be available post-purchase and the only response i have seen is,   "moto care is now available for moto z (non-droid versions) at the time of device purchase.
##we're still working on post-sales purchase, but this is progress, anyway!"
##so, as far as i can tell by talking to customer service and on the forum, if i happen to break my phone i am stuck with the full repair bill or wait, with a broken phone, for moto care to become available.
##that is assuming they will still let me purchase it when/if it does become available.
##with the lack of customer service i have seen so far, i wouldn't be surprised if they tell me that i have had the phone for too long for moto care to be available for purchase.
##i have a reference number for when i called customer service about this, within 30 days of purchasing the phone, but if it takes two more months to get this fixed i will seriously doubt that the reference number will matter.
##again, this is not amazon's fault.
##in fact, i wish i would have purchased the phone through amazon.
##amazon's customer service has always been fantastic and they would probably do something to rectify the situation if someone was to break their phone before moto care is available, but there is no way to know for sure.
##so, don't buy this phone yet.
[t]Fun phone but with some big draw backs
##this is a nice light weight/thin phone with really fun items to add on like a camera and speaker system.
##i purchased everything but the projector.
##they even sell the large battery pack which snaps on the back to let you use the phone much longer without recharging.
##since i had two note 7  phones which i had to return i was really excited about this system.
##they unlocked it so it works with my carrier t-mobile.
##going out to the washington coast this weekend i found out something about the phone which is a deal breaker for me and the impetus for this phone's return... t-mobile had no coverage where i was staying.
##i signed on to the property's wifi...i could not use wifi for texting or for phone calls.
##when i called today to motorola they said it was a carrier issue.
##when i called t-mobile they said since it was not a phone they carry they do not support wifi calling or texting.
##whhaatt?
##there are plenty of times when the network does not have good signal...been to hawaii lately?
##i always feel pretty safe knowing i can duck into a wifi hotspot and get a connection or help if i need to.
##not with this phone.
##too bad.
##the idea of new mods etc was exciting to look forward to.
##there were other things that did not work as smooth as samsung phones but i was willing to overlook them because this phone feels exciting and i looked forward to new add on mods.
##amazon is a champ for letting me return it within the 30 day period.
##i will have to figure out what to do with the accessories i purchased through verizon.
[t]Great bundle - phone and camera
##the unit has performed very well thus far.
##no problems with att compatibility - strong reception, works well teathered.
##with the moto-mod camera affixed, it is an ideal solution to having both a phone and decent if not spectacular camera along for the ride (and the price for the bundle was the clincher).
##battery life seems fine, the quick recharge is helpful.
##it seems to recharge fastest from the motorola charger; i have used other  qualcomm 3.0 chargers - its says "turbo charging" when connected - but the charge time seems to be noticeably longer...
[t]Two Stars
##to expensive for a small battery and weird buttons.
[t]Mehhh. Just okay.
##dangit lenovo.
##my elderly xt1053 first generation motox died about a year ago and i have been eagerly awaiting the motoz.
##i've been using an iphone 6 for that year.
##it hasn't been the worst year of my life.
##that award goes to the year i caught my incestuous ex-wife with her obese cousin.
##what sucks about the motoz?
##read on:  * it is simply too big.
##after a bowie-knife, a roll of duct-tape and a wallet stuffed with partially filled free-sandwich cards, i really don't have room in my pockets for the paper-back book this phone attempts to be.
##* the camera is somehow always blurry.
##this is great for pictures of my deep-appalachian family, but not so useful for insurance-shots of deer, bears and other wild animals that break into my house and steal my electronics and gold-bars.
##* the "wood-style-back" is, well... very roughly 'styled' after wood.
##a wood that shows oily fingerprints and feels like cheap plastic.
##my original motox had real wood backing.
##somehow i missed that "wood-style" means "not wood anymore".
##i admit, i researched weakly.
##if you want big, you want fake, and you want a camera that would make a shar-pei dog's face look unwrinkled, look no further.
[t]Excellent android phone ever
##excellent android phone i ever used too disappointed iphone 7 switching from ios to android  i usually don't do review but this moto z is smooth fast clean stock rom so thin and light motorola really did good job this time i think this is best phone in the market now i really enjoy this phone excellent excellent
[t]From A Moto Man!
##motorola has been through it all, and when they were on the down-slide, they hit a homerun with their moto x brand.
##yes, the devices didn't sell so hot...but android purists take a special liking to "x" phones as the software is top top top notch.
##welcome moto z...it's a moto x, and more!
##also...it's more money, but it's probably worth, just not to everyone!
##the software is moto, the design...motorola influenced!
##with that, if you are looking for a premium device, this is a premium device.
##sure, you might not like the fingerprint reader layout, the buttons are high (hard to reach), and the famous moto dimple is no more...but this is still a fantastic build.
##the wood panels also feel fantastic and complement the device very well while holding it.
##the device comes with a back panel, just so you know!
##oh yes...no mic jack.
##get over it.
##all manufactures have said that they will soon not support 3.5 jacks.
##the software is incredible.
##do you have a car bluetooth?
##yes?
##this phone will be your best friend while driving.
##flawless voice commands that are the best on the market.
##texting by voice alone has never been so easy.
##what moto adds to stock android is incredible.
##why can't other manufacturers do this???
##moto mods.
##mine are coming in the mail.
##i've used them.
##yes, they are too expensive.
##the battery pack might be worth it and the speaker to some.
##if you buy the projector...you must have kids or have money to burn!
##i can't wait to see what else they come up with for mods, but the so far they are too pricey and don't meet up to most people's expectations.
##keep in mind, on the jbl, you can adjust the bass up a bit more if bass is your thing.
##do this through the eq on the phone.
##the battery.
##it's good, just not great.
##this will last most users all day, with 10% to spare at bedtime.
##it's not bad.
##i'm guessing that 7.0 will increase battery life some.
##also, turn on battery saver and the battery saver for the individual apps.
##this does help.
##if you are an average user, the battery won't disappoint, but it won't be a major plus either.
##this is really a 4.5 device.
##it's a great start for mod devices and i can't wait to see what the moto line has in store in the future.
##the best ideas in android are with moto.
##from software to these mods, motorola is continuing major steps in the right direction.
##plus +  build quality (9/10) mods (great idea...too expensive) screen (above average) fingerprint scanner off/on function (works wwway better than samsung on the s7) great simple camera software (thank you) best android software experience moto voice can actually help you  middle  camera (best from moto, middle of the road in the industry) battery (should get you through the day) whites (a little too blue) volume buttons (wwway up there!)
##cons -  big chin!
##device feels terrible without backplate (kinda sharp) device is too big if you never use fingerprint scanner low light photos (could be fixed with update) the moto logo on the front (really???)
[t]The great underdog of phone.
##one of the best android ever made.
##the battery for a 2600mah is excellent.
##getting 4 to 5hr ost.
##the camera is spectacular.

[t]Mehhh. Just okay.
##dangit lenovo.
##my elderly xt1053 first generation motox died about a year ago and i have been eagerly awaiting the motoz.
##i've been using an iphone 6 for that year.
##it hasn't been the worst year of my life.
##that award goes to the year i caught my incestuous ex-wife with her obese cousin.
##what sucks about the motoz?
##read on:  * it is simply too big.
##after a bowie-knife, a roll of duct-tape and a wallet stuffed with partially filled free-sandwich cards, i really don't have room in my pockets for the paper-back book this phone attempts to be.
##* the camera is somehow always blurry.
##this is great for pictures of my deep-appalachian family, but not so useful for insurance-shots of deer, bears and other wild animals that break into my house and steal my electronics and gold-bars.
##* the "wood-style-back" is, well... very roughly 'styled' after wood.
##a wood that shows oily fingerprints and feels like cheap plastic.
##my original motox had real wood backing.
##somehow i missed that "wood-style" means "not wood anymore".
##i admit, i researched weakly.
##if you want big, you want fake, and you want a camera that would make a shar-pei dog's face look unwrinkled, look no further.
[t]Excellent android phone ever
##excellent android phone i ever used too disappointed iphone 7 switching from ios to android  i usually don't do review but this moto z is smooth fast clean stock rom so thin and light motorola really did good job this time i think this is best phone in the market now i really enjoy this phone excellent excellent
[t]From A Moto Man!
##motorola has been through it all, and when they were on the down-slide, they hit a homerun with their moto x brand.
##yes, the devices didn't sell so hot...but android purists take a special liking to "x" phones as the software is top top top notch.
##welcome moto z...it's a moto x, and more!
##also...it's more money, but it's probably worth, just not to everyone!
##the software is moto, the design...motorola influenced!
##with that, if you are looking for a premium device, this is a premium device.
##sure, you might not like the fingerprint reader layout, the buttons are high (hard to reach), and the famous moto dimple is no more...but this is still a fantastic build.
##the wood panels also feel fantastic and complement the device very well while holding it.
##the device comes with a back panel, just so you know!
##oh yes...no mic jack.
##get over it.
##all manufactures have said that they will soon not support 3.5 jacks.
##the software is incredible.
##do you have a car bluetooth?
##yes?
##this phone will be your best friend while driving.
##flawless voice commands that are the best on the market.
##texting by voice alone has never been so easy.
##what moto adds to stock android is incredible.
##why can't other manufacturers do this???
##moto mods.
##mine are coming in the mail.
##i've used them.
##yes, they are too expensive.
##the battery pack might be worth it and the speaker to some.
##if you buy the projector...you must have kids or have money to burn!
##i can't wait to see what else they come up with for mods, but the so far they are too pricey and don't meet up to most people's expectations.
##keep in mind, on the jbl, you can adjust the bass up a bit more if bass is your thing.
##do this through the eq on the phone.
##the battery.
##it's good, just not great.
##this will last most users all day, with 10% to spare at bedtime.
##it's not bad.
##i'm guessing that 7.0 will increase battery life some.
##also, turn on battery saver and the battery saver for the individual apps.
##this does help.
##if you are an average user, the battery won't disappoint, but it won't be a major plus either.
##this is really a 4.5 device.
##it's a great start for mod devices and i can't wait to see what the moto line has in store in the future.
##the best ideas in android are with moto.
##from software to these mods, motorola is continuing major steps in the right direction.
##plus +  build quality (9/10) mods (great idea...too expensive) screen (above average) fingerprint scanner off/on function (works wwway better than samsung on the s7) great simple camera software (thank you) best android software experience moto voice can actually help you  middle  camera (best from moto, middle of the road in the industry) battery (should get you through the day) whites (a little too blue) volume buttons (wwway up there!)
##cons -  big chin!
##device feels terrible without backplate (kinda sharp) device is too big if you never use fingerprint scanner low light photos (could be fixed with update) the moto logo on the front (really???)

[t]Warning! Will Robinson- I would not buy this...battery spontaneously overheats-  too pricy for risk issues
##the battery, ear phone, weak sound and daylight issues make me rate this a do not buy .
##moto z  2017...good looking, i like the screen size....sent to me 2.2018 as a warranty replacement for my 6yr old lg (rip) battery:  overheats (very hot) and all faqs i have read and answered by moto are weak  (essentially turn it off and let it cool)  this heat eats up battery life... somethings going on that kicks this baby into high gear, over heats (you will feel it in your pocket) and eats battery life...but i cannot tell what is the cause sound levels:  weak, need to be louder!
##back ground noise overwhelms picture:  good size, but invisible/weak in day/sunlight phone button and touch... very good- improved over my old lg charger... comes with 30amp quick charger... and the faqs recommend staying with it... but why do i want another piece of special gear... lets stay with the basic 5 v 1 amp.
##might be slow but most of us have all night... usb:  damn ... uses usb c... not compatible with most of my stuff.... will try an adapter.... though no court, c is a better mechanical connection.
##head phn plug... uses c.. now this is a problem... just because iphone does it why should we, now need an adapter or new hdphone (one provided ... just another loose piece to loose) motorola attachments... who cares... make one that attaches to my cars" screens ... other wise this is all marketig  bs and toys to break.

##however, the product does not have usb cable along with its package.

[t]Decent price
##so far seems great
[t]Great device. Especially for the price. I have a secret.
##i've worked in wireless for a decade.
##i've had probably, gosh, 80 phones or so.
##this one is among my favorites.
##there's not really a down side and it does everything a solid b+.
##the cost to benefit ratio is stellar.
##i paid 160$ for this  i also like to freeze cool whip and have it for a low cal sweet treat!
##but shhh don't tell anyone.
[t]GREAT phone, but watch out for "US Warranty" claim
##watch out for "us warranty" claim.
##one reason i purchased this phone was because it claimed a us warranty, but motorola will not back the warranty, and the seller simply told me i could return the item (motorola won't even allow me to register the device with them, and seller claims they bought it directly from motorola).
##a relative purchased the same phone through a different seller (also, on amazon), and he ran into the same issue.
##if you want a motorola-backed warranty, be aware that you may not get it if there is a seller other than amazon involved.
##otherwise, the phone is a fantastic upgrade from my moto x 2nd gen.  quite a size jump in length of device, but i do love the fingerprint reader (which is mainly what takes up the extra length of the phone).
##i am highly disappointed in the deceptive warranty part, but the actual phone is wonderful!

[t]Last Year's Flagship Is This Year's Best Budget
##i was looking hard at the moto x4 and the moto g5s+ before i bought this.
##both were a big upgrade from my 2014 moto x, and both were reasonably priced.
##i also spent hours and days comparing phones from huawei/honor, lg, nokia, sketchy no-name chinese brands etc.
##i initially bought a used example for $260ish, which didn't recognize my sim card, but got to know it for most of a month while i waited for a new sim card to come in.
##it was my phone for at home when there's no signal anyway.
##the new sim didn't work so i returned.
##by that point, the "new in box" price of the moto z had dropped to $299.
##if you're still looking at a moto z, go for it.
##it blows new models with similar price out of the water.
##with the wood "style shell" that comes with it, it almost feels as good as my old moto x. really, it's what i did when i bought my moto x just after the moto x pure came out.
##last year's top of the line beats this year's mid/budget for the same price.
[t]Why spend more?
##super thin and light.
##great screen.
##photos have come out good when indoors.
##ton of memory for my needs.
##android upgraded as soon as i had it running.
##no need to spend 2 or 3 times mores for a 8,9, or x if you just want a good phone.
##can't wait to get the projector mod.
[t]Not really usable.
##i bought this phone about a year ago.
##i returned it (and $25) for a warranty replacement because it kept shutting down even with the battery above 50%.
##after a few months, the replacement started doing the same thing, and then the screen failed (stayed all-black).
##i checked, and the warranty had just expired.
##i just bought an lg g6.
##i don't think i'll be buying anything from moto again soon.

##ordered two of these phones, both of them had different issues.
##the first one the blue tooth didn't work, and the second one constantly made popping noises.
##ended up sending both of them back
[t]Not a US phone
##quite disappointed the phone isn't for us since motorola won't honour the warranty.
##box had lots of indonesian sticker/manuals on it which prompted me to contact motorola support with my imei to see if it's covered.
##returning it but if it had warranty, the phone is nice to use.
[t]Pros: 1. thin 2. fast 3. ...
##pros: 1. thin 2. fast 3. mod usability if you are interested.
##cons: 1. this phone's battery life feels as if it were more than a year old.
##its saving grace is qc but other flagship phones also have that feature.
##2. the camera is unforgivable given its price range.
##3. since the above two things should stand out as flagship phone, it does not meet the expectations.
[t]Don't buy this phone
##this phone is really bad.
##even brand new, the battery doesn't last for a long time.
##to give you a concrete example, i left home today at 9.30am with 66% of battery.
##i had my phone on my jacket (so, not constantly playing with it), i only checked my email once (for around 10 minutes) and answered a phone call (under 2 mins).
##by noon, the battery had died..... no kidding.... the phone also gets frozen all the time and requires to be restarted to start working again.
##it's also quite slow.
##the design itself, which looked quite sleek upon opening the box, it's in fact very uncomfortable.
##the phone is too thin for its dimensions, and it slips.
##completely regret having bought this...
[t]Absolutely great phone for the $$$
##great phone that has all the features that i wanted, and despite it being an amazon warehouse deal that was supposedly there for who knows what reason, there was not a mark on it, absolutely no indication whatsoever that it had ever even been out of the box plus it had all of it's accessories with it, unlike most of the refurbished phones.
##and for those who would like to know, i simply took the sim card out of my old tracfone, inserted it into this new moto, booted it up, and it worked perfectly.
##it came out of the box with android 6 installed, but upon initial boot up, it immediately went to work downloading & installing android 7. once that was done, it proceeded to update many other things, one at a time, until everything was fully updated.
##i also like that it has a 64 gb internal memory so i am able to download all kinds of apps without running out of space.
##current count is 114 apps and i still have only used less that 16.5 gb.

##shame it was ruined by cheaping out on the wifi/bluetooth chip.
[t]Worst Phone Ever!
##this is worst phone i ever bought.
##the battery lasts only less than a day when it was bought and now only about a month later, the battery foes completely dead in less than 5 hours.
##make wonder if i bought a new phone or used one.
##worst experience!
##previously, i owned a moto z with 32 g memory and that phone worked well expect i ran out of storage space, that is why i bought this one with 64 g memory, but this performs much worse than my previous one.
[t]Terrible phone!

##mods is an interesting concept.
##have used it for 6 months so far.
##the bad: the back panel sits firm, but is kind of apparent that it is attached to the phone.
##also, for headphones you always need adapter usb-c to jack.
##the ugly: since 7.1.1 update there is a widespread issue with the battery charging.
##it is not changed properly and phone shuts down unexpectedly at 30-50-70% lasting for just one hour or less!!
##motorolla has been struggling with fixing it for quite a few months!

##worst investment ever.
##i bought this product from amazon and 10 months later the battery starts to fail.

[t]Review of 6 months usage
##i am writing this after 6 months usage of my unlocked moto z mobile.
##initial days it was too good and also i bought camera mod along with it and zoom is awesome.
##charging: but now charging is coming max of 6 hours with regular usage.
##since we don't have audio jack, we need to use wireless headphones or charging point along with connector.
##if you connect earphones through connector, you cannot charge the mobile.
##if you use wireless bluetooth headset, then charging will come only for 3 hours max.
##camera mod not working: after upgrading os to android 7.1.1, moto mod stopped working.
##whenever i'm connecting, it is  throwing error "restart camera".
##i reviewed many other blogs including moto, no solution provided.
##it's waste of 250$.
##i bought this mobile for mods feature only.
##i should have bought normal mobile and additional camera.
[t]Not Happy!!!
##camera issue right out of the box, called tech support and was told warranty is expired after i had it two weeks what???
##how is that right.
##i have had motorola for years and this is the worst one i have ever had seriously thinking another brand now
[t]decent phone with a few downsides
##it probably too soon to say whether or not i love this phone but there are a few things i can say.
##it has great battery life i used to have to charge my old phone every day around 3 not with the moto z it lasts the whole day.
##a few things that i have problems with the phone, i didn't realize it does not  have an aux, secondly its currently running android nougat 7.1 which apparently is the cause if its bluetooth not working( will update once phone updates if this is still a problem), also it has a usb c plug so i had to go buy all new cords.
##everything else about the phone is great its quick, calls are clear, and i no longer have to charge it twice a day.
[t]Five Stars
##all ok

##i had to return the cellphone because it was not unlocked.
[t]Good phone but it fells short
##well, i have had this mobile for 5 months now and i have mixed feelings, in one side this works flawlessly it never lags, i can open multiple apps without issues, the call quality is good, the camera is also very good during the day some amazing pictures but during the night its pretty avrg.
##on the build quality it feels good and strong even when its so thin!!
##the screen looks amazing and the sound is good.
##on the wrong side, the part of the back is some type of metal but it has a some sort of glass finish, it looks great!!
##however it catches a lot of dust and fingerprints really annoying, so i decided to cover it with one of the official covers, and i was really disappointed on how cheap it was , to be honest i was expected much more quality to go with this high quality mobile, i havent tried the leather one (very expensive compared to the others), just the nilon red and black ones and was very disappointed.
##other thing that i noticed last week is that the glass on the part of the back camera is already broken, i dont know how it did happen (since i havent dropped it or hit my phone i'm always really careful with them) and whatever happen i can say its because of the bad design on the camera i was expecting it to get scratched(i dont have any scratch yet)  because of the design but not broken.
##on the battery side it barely made it to the end of the day but it was expected with a 2600 battery.
##so overall i feel like this phone could have been more, i have yet to try the speaker mod

##the software on the phone itself is very good and there is no bloatware to be found.
##the main gripe with the phone is the design decision to make it very thin which decreases the size of the battery.

##the phone came with a bumper case (only protects sides) and a moto style case.
##ps: daydream works well on this device.
##like all of the current certified phones, the moto z will heat up a lot.

[t]Samstung
##when my recently paid off samsung s6 edge started coming apart because the battery was expanding and forcing it apart, and calls to tmobile and samsung failed, i looked for something else.
##samsung wanted 200 plus dollars to repair their failed battery and tmobile offered a samsung s7 for $200, i said no and they quickly dropped the price to free!
##i don't want to negotiate, i wanted my phone to be reliable for the $800 i spent on it!
##glad i purchased this moto z, it works great and because i bought it without all the crap bloat wear, it's even better.
##just put the sims card from the samstung into the moto and never had a problem!
[t]Well built phone with poor support and bad battery
##i've had this phone since december.
##over my time of owning the phone my opinions have changed drastically.
##at the moment, unless you want to have a battery mod on the phone 24/7, i do not recommend this phone.
##[screen]: the screen on this phone is definitely one of the highlights of the phone.
##its a nice size (5.5") and has good viewing angles.
##its a 1440p amoled screen and looks fantastic on the vibrant setting.
##colors pop and text is very sharp.
##it does get pretty bright, but could still stand to be brighter as it is hard to see in direct sunlight.
##it also doesn't get very dim, so using it at night can be blinding.
##[build and design]: this is a well build phone, most moto phones are.
##although this is the thinnest smartphone ever, it feels rock solid.
##probably the best built phone i've owned beside my old htc one m7.
##the design, however, is where things fall short.
##its a fine looking phone, but has some problems.
##first, the big one, no headphone jack.
##this is a trend that needs to stop.
##the headphone jack is not some old, out of date port.
##its a headphone jack.
##no point removing it at all, not a single reason.
##although having 2.5d glass looks and feels nice, it does expose more of the glass to damage when dropped.
##it also means that tempered glass screen protectors will have to be smaller than the screen.
##although i love having a super thin phone, i don't think it is worth it which i'll explain later.
##another problem is the screen to body ratio is not very good, this phone has huge chins.
##there's also a moto logo right on the front of the phone, which looks pretty tacky.
##the back metal is a pretty big fingerprint magnet.
##[camera]: its ok. motorola is not known for not having great cameras, and this continues the trend.
##pictures look good when in good lighting and after a bit of tweaking, but in any other light its pretty below average.
##it uses a pretty old sensor, the sony imx214, which was actually used in the nexus 6 and oneplus one.
##video quality is pretty good though, especially the 4k hdr recording.
##overall its enough to point and shoot type stuff, but if you really like using your phone for taking pictures, you'd be much better off with something else.
##[connectivity]: i'm using this on at&t and have also used it abroad too.
##abroad it worked great, i was able to easily connect and switch networks and maintained lte coverage the whole time.
##back in the us, however, its a different story.
##up until june everything worked fine.
##since then, things have been different.
##now, it is very rare that i will connect to lte.
##instead, it seems to default to h. switching apns, changing preferred network type, factory resetting, and updating the phone have not fixed this issue.
##now i'm stuck on h.  [sound]: i love having a speaker on the front of the phone.
##not as nice as having dual front speakers, but better than bottom speakers.
##the sound quality from the speaker is pretty good, but it doesn't get that loud.
##as for headphone output, its good and bad.
##it is nice and loud, which is nice as i've used some devices that are very quiet.
##the sound quality, unfortunately, isn't the best, probably because of not having a headphone jack.
##audio through the usb c port is scaled down to 16bit quality instead of the standard 24bit audio.
##audio is still pretty clear, but bass is lacking, even with eq.
##about that eq, the eq is very limited.
##its just a measly 5 band equalizer that you cant even customize, there's just a few presets you can choose.
##once again, overall its just alright.
##[ui and software]: the ui is fantastic.
##moto has the best skin out there.
##its pretty much stock android with a few great tweaks like moto approach, gestures, and customizing your ok google phrase to anything you want.
##because of all this this phone flies through the ui.
##software updates is yet another blemish on this phone.
##they are very few and far between, with the model, the us unlocked variant, being to last to receive all updates for the most part.
##moto has said that they will not be committing to the security updates, and that is one promise they have kept.
##i have only gotten 2 updates since i've had the phone, one for 7.0 and one for a security update.
##and, seeing how moto has treated some of their other phones, i wouldn't expect too many more updates for this phone.
##[performance]: this is a very good performing phone.
##i believe it is the fastest sd820 phone there is.
##however, ever since the nougat update, i get a lot of stuttering sometimes and a few app frees and crashes, mainly settings and camera.
##overall though, its still a great performing phone.
##it does get very hot.
##even with light use (i don't really do any heavy use since i don't play games on my phone), it tends to warm up a lot, sometimes enough to even be uncomfortable to hold.
##[battery]: finally, we arrive at the battery.
##when i bought this phone, i didn't expect it have the best battery.
##i mean, it has a 2600mah battery.
##that's pretty laughable for any size phone nowadays.
##this is the thinnest smartphone ever made, so there has to be some tradeoff.
##well, when i got the phone, i was actually amazed.
##i was easily making it through the whole day without needing to charge and was consistently getting over 6 hours of screen on time(sot).
##this was way better than any phone i'd had before.
##i had a battery mod, but rarely needed to use it, mainly put it on when i was traveling or when i knew i would be away from a charger for longer than a day or so.
##this continued for a few months.
##those were some good months.
##then, i received the update to android nougat.
##from there, i immediately noticed a drop in battery (and yes, i did a clean install).
##i went from averaging 6+ hours sot to about 5 hours sot.
##standby drain also increased.
##not a huge decrease, but was still disappointing.
##over the next few months, it has only gotten worse.
##now, i average about 3 hours sot and have a standby drain of almost 4% per hour.
##the phone also gets hot more often and according to accubattery, i only have 81% of my original 2600mah battery left, making it effectively a 2000mah battery, smaller than my htc one m7 i had years ago.
##i haven't made it through the day without needing to charge in weeks.
##its extremely frustrating and disappointing.
##the battery mod is required now, and i don't like that.
##the battery mod should be something that you use when you need to extra juice, not to make your phone usable .
##just based on this alone, i would stay away from this phone.
##[moto mods]: moto mods are a really cool idea, and definitely the best implementation of modular smartphone technology.
##the execution is not quite as great.
##there isn't anything wrong with the mods really, except for the camera which actually has a worse sensor than the built in camera, its more the price.
##the style shells are priced fine, they're pretty cheap.
##the speaker mods are a bit expensive and a standalone bluetooth speaker will definitely sound better but they are very convenient.
##the battery mods also shine with their convenience and ease of use compared to a standalone backup battery, but you do lose out on charge speed and capacity( you can get a 30000+mah backup battery for the price as the battery mod, which is 2220mah).
##i do think it is a good buy though if you can get one on sale or from ebay.
##like i said above, the camera mod is way too expensive and worse than the stock camera except for the zoom.
##the projector is also really nice, but yet again you trade quality for convenience, soft of.
##i don't mean the build quality is bad, but for the same price you can get a much much better projector  that works with all your devices instead of just your phone.
##i also say you get more convenience because while it is more convenient as its attaches to your phone and just shows what's on the screen, you cant project a movie or anything and use your phone for something else.
##overall, if the mods were all cheaper they'd be a great buy, and they still are, but you have to be really committed to the moto ecosystem to justify the price of some of them.
##if you are looking for a z series phone, this probably isn't for you.
##go with the z play or the z2 play, they are just better phones.
[t]Slick! Add a huge SD card with the savings you get buying at this price point.
##best.moto.phone.yet!
##if the luscious detail and color pop of the display doesn't grab you, the speed of operation may well do the trick!
##for example: this thing flies through updates.
##as an indicator; a 22m update for google docs will take approximately four to six seconds to perform.
##on the moto x2 i upgraded from, the same install process for that single update would have lasted well over 20 seconds.
##to me this is a huge step forward in processing power.
##it takes at&t lte longer to download the updates than it takes the moto z to install them.
##the fingerprint detection is fantastic, once you go through the set up process.
##i chose to bind the phone's detection system with a finger from each of my hands, which is very helpful.
##the reader is really nimble, virtually instant, and the reader square is easy to find with one's fingertip in the dark.
##like i said, the fingerprint reader is super responsive; more so than my recent vintage laptop's fingerprint reader.
##i think the verbal interface is beginning to shine, and gets most of my speech right.
##commands spoken to the phone, initiated by a key phrase (default is "google now" to 'wake up' its ears, example:  "google now  set timer 8 minutes".
##the phone will reply:  "okay, starting timer 8 minutes."
##i think the default wake-up is cheesy.
##i changed my wake-up phrase to something uniquely my own.
##for adventures in the power of this phone's features, run an internet search for "15 first things every moto z droid and moto z force droid owner should do" and read through what phandroid put together.
##the tenth point:  'activate googles secret menu and speed up your device' is one such gem.
##i would have never come across it otherwise.
##speaking of update downloads.
##this is about when i first brought up the phone (after i took it to at&t store to get the sim changed.
##note: while i had the sim tray open i added the sandisk extreme 128gb microsdxc card i brought along from another amazon purchase i made when ordering the phone.
##192gb of storage with a fast quad core cpu - yes!!
##i reconfigured the camera app to use this storage instead of the phone's onboard.)
##the nitty gritty of first set up: there was a verrry long, drawn out series of mammoth updates to the initial build of the phone as shipped.
##first the screen prompted me to okay a system upgrade to version 7.
##(android nougat).
##sure; why not.
##1.5gb of download and one or more reboots later... then several rounds of motorola's updates, totaling over 200m... and more reboots.
##then google joined the party to announce it had another 250mb+ of updates, for apps.
##well, better to have all this done up front than sometime later.
##i should add that you will also need a wi-fi connection for the phone during this procedure - because some of these updates won't run over the carrier, and the phone will tell you when you must connect to wi-fi in order to continue.
##come to think of it, after all this updating i began to get a battery low indicator even though i had it connected to the charger.
##i found that by unplugging the cord and turning it over (usb-c is a symmetrically shaped plug) the phone suddenly woke up to 'charger connected'.
##call me superstitious, but i put a sharpie marker dot on the top side of the plug so i would always plug it in that way, if it was a problem?
##maybe i didn't have it pushed all the way in tight.
##that's just as possible.
##the metal plug should completely disappear into the phone port or it isn't securely connected.
##the charger i received with this moto z is considerably different than the charger that came with the moto x2.
##for one, its now "turbo" (15-watt) which speeds up charging to three times faster than the moto x. you can get a 40% charge in 25 minutes, or from 0-100% in about 80 minutes.
##the ac plug end of the charging cable is now quite large (2"h x 1.75"w x .875"d) and it is permanently attached to the cord.
##that means if you want/need a way to cable-connect your moto z to another computer you will need to purchase a separate cable: a usb type a to type c male-male.
##there's only one quirk (con?)
##i can think to point out about this phone.
##perhaps it's related to or has something to do with the security posture?
##security i enabled by activating its fingerprint reader, which also prompted me to establish an access pattern from an array of dots arranged on the screen like a touchtone phone key pad.
##(in fact, those dots are numbers on a touchtone key pad.
##memorize what the number string associated with your saved access pattern equates to.
##i have read that there are certain instances where people have found themselves stranded facing a password prompt they didn't know they had input.
##however, they did - as a pattern!
##which is numerical under the hood.)
##anyway, to the point of my gripe:  when i power on the phone after shut down, it boots up with a spiel of graphics, then screen prompts me for the access pattern i set the phone to, and then it boots all over again!
##some research indicates that this is because the first time is to access android and the 2nd time is to access the desktop.
##however, it seems to me this process could be streamlined not to look like two complete boot ups.
##i have gotten over the much-lamented lack of a 3.5mm audio plug - for which the phone comes packaged with an 5" long adapter/dongle which converts the phone's type c usb port into a 3.5mm stereo audio jack for wired headphones or speakers.

##for four months it worked great until, the screen went black and i could no long see how to work it
[t]Not Verizon
##this phone will not work with verizon network.
[t]5 stars
##i've ordered one previously and it turns out it was a defective one.
##it kept turning on and off itself and constantly going into a boot loop and then shuting down.
##i've received a replacement phone and i have gotta give it 5 stars!
##absolutely good phone and screen is gorgeous!
[t]Gstyle
##i have a windows phome.
##it doesn't compare to this one.
##it has so many other features.
[t]Nice phone.  Solid.  Bad glass front (break)
##i've had this phone now for about a year.
##the off the grid batteries are good (i have 3).
##the phone uses the battery fast.
##as far as long life...unused, sitting on the desk, it will go about 24-26 hours.
##with the off grid power pak.
##i like the wireless charging capabilities.
##i wish motorola sold the wireless charger as it took me forever to find out wireless chargers will all charge this phone, you don't need a special one.
##i had issues in the beginning with the wireless charging batteries...(i was sent wired charging battery and didn't know it)....it took some major effort to get motorola to even talk to me....service is not their forte.
##but eventually they did fix it.
##the glass front is guaranteed to break!
##the side bumper will help if the phone is tapped straight on the side.
##but the glass of anyone i know (5) has broken for all within a month or two.
##motorola needs to help that out a bit.
##the mods are awesome.
##i have the off the grid power paks and although i don't get the "off grid" ability with just one....i'd need 1 per 24 hour period.
##i love them.
##easier than finding an outlet somewhere.
[t]Don't buy this phone if you plan on trying to tether.
##i bought this phone direct from motorola.
##when i first got it, i loved it.
##it was running marshmallow and every feature worked - including tethering (on cricket).
##soon after i updated the os to nougat and then there were two or three more security updates immediately after that.
##once i applied all of these updates tethering no longer worked.
##the phone started checking with carrier as to whether my phone was authorized for tethering.
##this is unacceptable on an unlocked non-carrier branded device.
##its my phone, my plan - i should be able to use it as i please without it going behind my back to check with carrier as to what features my plan included.
##in the 10 days i had it - it was probably the best phone i ever owned.
##lighting fast (waaaaay faster than my s7 edge).
##but motorolas decision to start checking with the carrier about tethering totally ruined it.
##i returned it for a full refund.
[t]I really love this phone
##i really love this phone, however for the first time ever with a phone (and i've had a cell phone steady since 1997) my speaker has gone to crap.
##it works but you can't understand anything.
##or take any calls without a bluetooth ear piece, which is rather inconvenient at times.
##now i have to get it fixed at who knows the cost, because my retarded phone company didn't properly update my phone.
[t]Stay away from this device if you need bluetooth.
##i bought mine in january 2017 and 4 months later bluetooth simply stopped working.
##i have now opened a rma and will receive a refurbished device, which i'm absolutely mad about as i thought i was acquiring a premium device.
##i would much rather spend all the money (+ incipio battery mod, + 200 gb memory card) in an iphone 7+ with 256 gb.
##update: it got even worse.
##i submitted a rma and got an "as new" phone.
##1 week after now the wi-fi is not working at all.
##i give up.
##i've thrown $580 to the garbage.
##stay away of this phone.
[t]Five Stars
##excellent phone
