[t]Good phone for the near hundred dollar price point.  No frills, GPS works, slow charger included, battery lasts for days standby
##a good phone for the near hundred dollar price point.
##i received one that was a verizon version according to the firmware, but it was unlocked and still works fine for at&t towers via tracfone.
##gps works fine with this one, but leaving it on all the time will drain your battery faster.
##1a included charger is slow, but will charge faster with a 2a car charger etc.
##standby lasts for several days if you only make a couple calls a day.
##this is my second one because i broke the screen on the first after about a year and couldn't be without one for the week waiting for the new screen.
##this time i bought a better screen protector, so maybe it will last more than a year this time.
##no bells and whistles but still a good phone if you're not in need of the latest and greatest.
[t]It was locked!!
##advertised as unlocked but came as a locked verizon phone.
##returned it.
##negative 3 stars for hassle.
[t]GSM support failed
##it might be just my experience but a) this phone is branded to verizon and b) after updating the os to android 7.1.1 - as suggested - gsm is no longer supported and can't make or receive phone calls with t-mobile sim card.
##the sim card works fine in my old phone.
##neither t-mobile support nor motorola support could fix the phone.
##i had to send the phone back.
##looked like a nice phone.
[t]Pretty good once a nice guy from TracFone did his job very well
##i will say this first, i do not have high expectations from phones as i do with other electronics eg.
##my computers.
##i use it for calling, texting, and such and sometimes for light games.
##all i will say is that it is a fast and reliable for light use that i got when the price was like $104 so i am so happy i bought it then.
##my alcatel pixi unite sucked and hardly lasted a year with considerably light usage.
##the glass is hard to get fingerprints on, by the way, and it's is a sturdy construction (if you drop your phone, the case will stay on because it has clips all around the interior of the back panel).
##for those looking to use this phone with tracfone like me, please remember that this is a gsm unlocked, not cmda.
##do not try to switch the sim from your old phone to your new phone because tracfone deals out service according to the... imei, or serial number, something like that.
##they have to manually switch service from your old phone to the new phone using a new sim from the byop pack ($10ish at walmart), it will take half an hour to an hour for all the verification to complete so make sure you have time.
##if you give tracfone the verizon sim # in the byop pack (should be the last one in the red), they will tell you the phone is not compatible (especially if that person is talking to you late at night and really wants to go home, and will give you no further explanation or help other than "the phone is not compatible").
##notify them immediately that your phone is gms unlocked and they will help your from there, you have to use the att or t-mobile sim in the byop pack (i literally had to call the next day when they opened back up since they closed before i could call again, and i made sure to tell the man everything i could about the phone to avoid further... unnecessary setbacks).
##also, when i got the phone, it stated in the settings that it's service is verizon.
##do not let that fool you, verizon is a cmda carrier so it is a misnomer.
##if neither att or t-mobile work with the phone (try the other if one won't work to be certain), consider that the phone might not be unlocked due to whatever occurrence and return it for another to see if a replacement will work (make sure you keep all the packaging until you verify that the phone service works).
[t]Worked Until ...
##worked great until i was pushed an android 7 update.
##totally trashed the phone.
##can no longer get mms consistently.
##works for a few ... then its doa for a few hours.
##verizon pre-paid.
##tried a complete factory rest hoping to go back to android 6 ... no go.
##tried it from the boot loader,  phone is now locked in 7 hell.
##totally sucks.
##worked flawlessly until update.
##i would suggest opening developer options and blocking auto updates and avoid the 7 update if you can.
##phone shopping now.
##guess its time for an e4
[t]Exactly what I ordered!
##the moto g 4 i received was thankfully exactly what i ordered.
##it came new and in the condition advertised.
##it works really well and was surprisingly uncluttered by unnecessary apps.
##my only concern was that there was no english in the manual period, but that can be easily overlooked i guess.
##in all, a great phone at a great price!
[t]Worst cell phone ever
##after 3 months, this cell phone died!!!!!
##in the first mont some buttons started to stop working...and now it does not work at all!!!!
##don't buy this model or brand.

##not many features.
[t]I love my new phone.
##this is a good phone, really nice graphics, and it works fine with a ukrainian cell phone plan.
[t]No restart no personal ringtone
##good phone but doesn't have a restart option and no option for personal ringtone.
[t]Great except for camera
##i bought this phone for use while traveling out of the country.
##it's a good value.
##it has a good screen.
##i like the larger screen especially when i don't have my laptop or ipad with me on trips.
##i normally use an iphone, so there was a learning curve to learn how to navigate all the android options on this phone.
##my main complaint about this phone is the camera is slow to focus and the picture quality is not great.
##that's a real bummer since it's the phone i want to take on vacation trips when i want to take lots of photos.
##a secondary complaint is that it takes longer than expected to recharge.
##it has a large battery which explains part of the reason it is slow to charge.
##i haven't tried another charger yet that might deliver more current to it and speed up the process.
[t]It's a great smart phone that cost me around $165 plus $40 ...
##i bought this phone based on deep analysis of several motorola's models.
##this is the xt1621 codename athene.
##it has only 2g ram but for android this is not a problem.
##the storage is 16g but because the phone is expandable, i installed 64g microsd.
##starting on android version 6, the additional microsd be formatted as internal storage.
##it supports most of the carriers in america and the difference from model g5 is minimal.
##it's a great smart phone that cost me around $165 plus $40 for the additional storage.
##from now on i will never pay more then $300 in a smartphone.

##very good phone, general purpose and much more, great screen.
[t]After few months of buying it, another better phone came up.
##screen size is nice and the feel when using this phone.
##one thing i dont like is when i use the camera, randomly after like 2 shots, the shutter key went missing and even pressing the volume rocker doesnt take pictures.
##i have to press the home botton and reopen the camera app.
##maybe a firmware bug but hopefully they fix it.
##i love the front camera tho.
##im not impressed with the rear camera and the preset effects.
##panorama shot is not good in my opinion.
##battery life is impressive, i use t-mobile on this phone and sometimes i can't get coverage.

##recently purchased this item.
##i bought one for my wife and she likes it a lot and i needed and upgrade too so i went for it also.
##the one i ordered i think is a defective product... in the first week, it was acting strange, opening a lot a pages all on its own in the browser and in google play.
##also, i am unable to send normal sms text messages on the stock text message app that is already installed on the phone.
##i called my carrier (at&t) and did some trouble shooting, but my efforts have been unsuccessful.
##i do think though that i solved or got rid of the virus or whatever was going on with it, because i'm not having those erratic issues going on anymore.
##i do think it is a good product, but i think i received a defective device.
##has anyone else experienced problems with texting?
##it's not sending, but receiving.
##i did find out last night though that i can send messages but i need to switch to mms, and the messages are extremely limited.

##nice phone, but unfortunately for me the price dropped like 30 bucks 2 weeks after i received it and now the g5 cost only a few bucks more of what i paid of this one, and this is the first handset i've purchased so not the best experience for me, the next time i'll do a better research of when a newer model will be released.

[t]Screen crapped out
##i owned the moto g4 about three months and paid $200.00 for it and was generally pretty happy with it...i was planning on being repeat customer because it was a good phone on the cheap.
##well, about a day ago, my screen started going haywire -- it's washed out, has a ghosting effect, and has been a pain to use because i can't see text clearly.
##it's bad.
##i went online, on youtube, trying to figure out a fix it to no avail.
##i won't be returning to motorola as a future customer, or android.
[t]Great dual-SIM International smartphone FOR SPANISH SPEAKERS ONLY.
##this dual-sim phone is very convenient when you must receive calls from two different sim cards.
##plus it works in all foreign countries.
##for about six months it worked fine.
##then i started to get a screen with the title "new system software available" and then a long text in spanish language.
##i do not understand spanish language (i know only two languages, and spanish is not one of them), therefore i cannot do what this screen suggests.
##but it keeps popping up every time when i use my phone, which is very annoying.
##so today i went to motorola help webpage and chatted with three tech support specialists (the first one did not have the answer, so i was switched to the second, who did not speak english, and only the third one was able to "answer" my question.
##this is exactly what he answered: ---------- carlos: you have purchased the device from cayman island?
##dmitri t.: i purchased this device in maryland, the united states, from an internet store amazon.com.
##carlos: i can see that the warranty of the device i not in the us, i would advised you to contact amazon regarding with this because we are us support here and we don't support dual sim phones.
##dmitri t.: that is very interesting.
##the dual-sim phone is made by motorola and you (motorola) do not support a product made by your company?
##this information will be posted to many blogs.
##carlos: we support those, however we are us support, we don't support dual sim phones, the reason why i'm advising you to contact amazon is because the warranty of the device is not in the us.
##motorola us doesnt support dual sim, we don't offer dual sim in the us.
[t]really nice, unexpensive phone
##really nice, unexpensive phone!
##if you are in venezuela as i am i hardly recommend you to buy the dual sim version that works for all of our carriers and you will avoid the problem with the gps on 3g cuz you will have lte with digitel.

##it's a great phone at a great price.
##16 gb internal memory, dual sim, full hd 1080p, 5.5" screen, 4g, 3000 mah battery, 13 mp camera, comes with android 6.0 and i updated to android 7.0  it has all the necessities.
##the camera is ok, it doesn't have nfc, no finger print scanner.
##charging this phone is a pain.
##it takes forever to charge.
##i have noticed that it takes around 3-4 hours even if the battery was close to 50%.
##also, the charger that comes with it, is not a usb cable, it can only be used as wall mount.

[t]Writing this review from my new phone because the G4 kept dying
##all 11 years i've owned a cellphone, i have considered myself lucky.
##all the errors that users of a particular phone i've owned  have reported, i've managed to avoid.
##that is until i pre-ordered the moto g4.
##the first few months of owning the g4 were perfect.
##it was much faster than my former motorola razr maxx hd, and the screen was beautiful.
##a few months in, the phone started to have issues with ghost touching.
##the random dialing was a major issue.
##the ghost touching also affected the lockscreen to my annoyance, as it kept pressing one of dots on the pattern over and over and wouldn't let up until i put my phone to sleep.
##the phone also would randomly die if i called someone, watched a video, or used the gps.
##if i turned the phone back on, i would find that the battery had drained down to 1%.
##the support at lenovo was horrendous.
##there were several posts at the forums from users with the same issues that i've had, and the support techs seem to only answer with, "all phone models deal with random shut downs."
##i had the option to send the phone in for repair/replacement, but i had dealt with this phone for over a year and i desperately needed a phone to work correctly.
##i bit the bullet and bought a much pricier phone that has worked much better  than the g4 ever did.
##it's really such a shame as i've had two motorola phones in the past, and i've never encountered such terrible issues that makes a phone practically useless.
[t]Worst smart phone I've ever owned
##i bought this about a year ago when my samsung note 3 started dying.
##well, the time finally came and i am looking for a new phone again.
##this phone drops connection to pretty much everything it can on a random and regular basis.
##lte network, wifi networks, bluetooth devices... you name it and this phone will drop connection to it for no explainable reason.
##i've had iphones and i've had samsungs but i'll never buy a motorola again.
[t]Five Stars
##nice
[t]this is the best phone I've ever had
##pros: unlike some brands, this phone doesn't seem require you to have a bunch of random apps that take up precious space.
##and the camera is phenomenal, it even shoots 1080p video incredibly well.
##cons: i have some issues with it lagging from time to time, but i have dropped it a handful of times and i have a very thin case.
##that probably has a lot to do with it lol.
##overall i gave it a 5 because for the cost, this is the best phone i've ever had.
[t]Apparently overheating is a common flaw, which Lenovo will not address
##ordered this to replace a (presumably) dead phone.
##apparently they have a common flaw where they overheat after a few minutes of heavy use.
##mine gets hot just sitting on the desk, not doing anything.
##the area behind the power button gets so warm i can't hold the phone comfortably.
##i fear what heavy use will do- i might be able to cook something with the radiant heat.
[t]Pretty Nice Mid-range smartphone
##it's a pretty nice mid range phone, with only one issue.
##the turbo charger seems to get the battery real hot, so i opted for a lower output charger, which works just as good, without all the heat.

##beautiful phone, unfortunately everything is in spanish - absolutely nothing is in english.

##i didn't realize that "international version" meant updates would all be in spanish, despite selecting english as the language during startup.
[t]Junk
##out of all the phones i've owned this one is by far the worst
[t]That this is a piece of garbage.
##worst phone i've ever bought..i guess you get what you pay for.
##ads pop up in the middle of trying to email or text...and that's the least of it.
[t]beautiful screen and quite loud
##fast phone, responsive, beautiful screen and quite loud.
##surprisingly well made for the price point.
##would recommend for everyone.
##one draw back is not having the turbo charge enabled charger out the box, so to get that function activated one has to purchase another usb charger that is qualcomm 2.0 enabled in order to benefit from a feature built in to the phone.
##otherwise its 6 hours per charge using the out the box charger.

##after two days seems to be working all right (according to my wife).
[t]best phones I've bought in any class
##i don't normally do a followup, but in this case, i thought i'd mention this is an extremely competitive sharp model in its class - and i'd spent another $70 for mine.
##one of  - if not the, best phones i've bought in any class.great screen pic's.
##you can now likely step up for an even better moto model.

[t]These have been great phones for me
##this is my third motorola phone.
##the first two were dropped into the lake.
##these have been great phones for me.
##the battery life is great, it does everything i need it for, and it is reasonably priced.
##there is nothing that i dislike.
[t]Good
##best product, it is software appliance, there are many wrong system updates, reducing the performance from the original.
[t]Motorola is bad
##i purchased two of these for my kids because i felt that motorola was a reputable company.
##i was sure wrong.
##one of the phones had erratic screen behavior.
##i called the motorola customer service.
##after a few minutes explaining my problem, the service rep declared that i would have my phone replaced.
##i was in awe, thinking that motorola was all i expected it to be.
##unfortunately, that was not to be; after checking my device identification, the rep told me that my phone was out of warranty.
##i was astonished.
##i provided proof of purchase showing that my phone was purchased 6 months ago.
##in due course, i spoke with 3 motorola representatives, who all followed the exact same script, telling me that my phone was purchased from a 3rd party retailer on amazon so they could not honor the warranty.
##they told me that my phone was an international version, sold in the country of kentucky, not in the united states.
##i explained that kentucky is a state in the united states, but to no avail.
##at long last, my only recourse is to let all of you know that motorola is bad and does not stand behind their products.
##a manufacturer warranty should be honored by the manufacturer, regardless of who the seller is.
[t]phone status
##i gave it 3 starts cause my phone has a defect the sd card slot keeps telling me that my sd cards are corrupt change 2 cards and same problem but its a great device  love it but due to the problem 3 stars purchased on september 12
[t]Top budget phone for real!
##from the performance to the battery life.
##at this price it's undersold.
[t]so so...
##the fever is serious and is not suitable for uber driver.
[t]For the first two week this phone worked good. Then the ghost things happened
##for the first two week this phone worked good.
##then the ghost things happened.
##it has multiple software problems.
##the touch does not work good after the first two weeks of usage.
[t]Motorola Rules
##good cell phone to meet the basic needs of a non-demanding user
[t]Started off good, but now some issues
##update:  since my initial review, the phone started experiencing ghost touch or flickering issues.
##even just trying to unlock the phone or shut it down became a chore sometimes.
##other reviewers have reported the same thing.
##there are youtube videos that claim to help you fix this.
##i looked at those and tried several ways to fix it, all to no avail.
##i read that if you adjust the adaptive brightness controls, that should fix it.
##no.
##finally, i read online that one way you can fix this issue is to switch this to developer mode and select the developer option that tells the gpu to manage the screen composition.
##it was also suggested that you download the eye filter app from the play store and set the black colors to 4% opacity.
##none of this worked for the long haul.
##the only thing that seems to work so far is to turn down the screen brightness all the way.
##you can still see it indoors or in dark settings, though bright sunlight may be a challenge.
##so far i've had no issues when the screen brightness is turned way down.
##the only caveat is that you may not want to continually use the phone at minimum brightness.
##even turning up the level to midway will set off the flickering again.
##in the.
##meantime, i've noticed some orange-yellowish tint on the upper right hand side of the screen - possible burn-in issue.
##i also can't get the sd card reader to work correctly.
##in more ways than one, this budget phone is showing why it's a budget phone.
##this was a four-star review.
##sadly i have to cut it down to 3.  i bought the moto g4 at best buy in the spring of 2017.  i usually do a lot of research before buying an electronic device, but i had to make an unusually quick decision given that my previous phone, the moto x (2nd edition/2014) experienced a faulty charging port.
##i did not have time to send it back to motorola and besides, it was out of warranty since i had owned it for nearly a year and a half when the charging port failed.
##note to self, "be extra careful each time you plug in to charge; not that this is guaranteed to prevent port failure).
##i was a bit weary about buying another moto phone, as i was afraid a similar problem may occur with subsequent moto devices.
##however, for the price i paid (about $135; or $165 when i added in a 2 year protection/replacement plan at best buy), i rolled the dice on the moto g4.
##i did not realize there was a plus version with a better camera and a fingerprint sensor when i bought the g4 - and when i purchased it, it was at the same time that the moto g5 plus came out.
##having already purchased the moto g4, it made no sense to return it and to get a different phone until i gave it a real college try.
##with the little bit of research i was able to do, i reasoned that the moto g4 might be okay.
##i did not love that it came with only 16 gb of storage, but unlike my moto x (2nd gen), the moto g4 came with a micro sd card slot for expandable memory.
##except for the fact that the phone did not have that nice distinctive curved back like my previous one, i liked that it was just as thin and almost as light in the hand.
##i liked the slightly taller 5.5 inch profile, which wasn't any harder to operate than the previous 5.2 incher.
##due to the slightly larger dimensions, i lost about 23 pixels per inch on the resolution and i was disappointed that i had to give up the nice amoled screen for the ips display.
##that said, this moto g4 has almost as nice a display as the moto x, especially when you turn on vibrant colors.
##i miss the moto voice feature that i had with the moto x.  i loved being able to just talk to the phone without having to pick it up.
##while you can use google voice to perform many of the same functions, it only works if you have the phone turned on.
##if it is in the off position, it won't work.
##i do like that you can still twist to turn on the camera and do the chop chop action to turn on the led light.
##also, you have a bigger battery with the moto g4 (3,000 mah vs. just 2300).
##the phone provides an almost stock android experience.
##it came with android marshmallow and i upgraded to nougat.
##i'm not sure if it will get oreo, but if it does, it will be a while.
##for a while, i noticed some of the ghost touching issues others have reported.
##but i recently installed some updates and that seems to have fixed the issue.
##we'll see if that lasts.
##the processing speed seems good and again, with the update, things seem really quick and buttery smooth, especially over wifi.
##i'm on t-mobile and if i go over my 4g lte high speed data limit, i do notice the throttled speeds when online.
##you definitely want to get some kind of case for this, because it does scratch easily, especially along the sides.
##it picks up dents and dings easily if dropped.
##however, i've dropped this thing a few times (and some were big drops without a case) and the screen took it like a champ.
##the camera is so-so.
##nothing to write home about, but it does have some manual mode controls that allow you to maximize your image quality.
##low light conditions are a struggle, though.
##for your average photo to share online, via text, or email, it is more than sufficient.
##so long as you know that you are buying a budget device and that you are not getting top of the line specs, you should be pleased with this phone.
##this is my sixth smart phone - and i've had the iphone as well as samsungs - and i don't think i've found a perfect device yet.
##i also don't see the point to ever spend more than about $300 for a phone - and if you can spend less for something just as good at the $300 price point or higher, even better.
##i was a bit wary about buying another moto after what happened to my moto x, but for the price, i've owned this phone for going on 8 months now and so far i'm reasonably satisfied.
##it does what it needs to do.
##it takes ok pictures, is quite speedy, the volume and call reception is good (in fact, t-mobile seems to have improved its reception in my area in just the past few months), has a nice screen that isn't hard to look at, and the battery has generally gotten me through at least a full day, sometimes into the next day.
##i could have returned this, spent more, and got a higher end phone, but you never know what trade-offs you will end up having to settle for.
[t]Good for the price
##bought this as a gift for my nephew.
##he loves it!
##nothing is wrong with it so far.
##he's happy!

[t]Good unlocked choice
##bought this unlocked for a trip abroad (iceland).
##i'm not an android user daily but this phone has plenty of capability and using a foreign sim card was very easy.

[t]This is one of the best phones I've ever purchased
##amazon music tells me this motorola is my 22nd android device :)  so i've had many androids over the years.
##most recently a nexus 6, which i lost, replaced by a lg g4 which ended up bricked.
##so i bought this budget android not expecting too much really.
##i've had other budget androids including zte, lg, samsung etc.
##this is one of the best phones i've ever purchased.
##hands down better device than the g4 at a 1/4 of the price.
##i cannot tell you how happy i am with it.
##i would have to seriously consider whether to use my nexus 6 if i were to find it.
##unlocked out of the box with no extra ads of any kind.
##no carrier ads, no packaged/bundled useless software, etc.
##it is straight up android (upgrading automatically to android 7 out of the box) and it works perfectly.
##i would give this phone 10 stars if i could based on value relative to price.
##it is 10 times the quality of anything put out by blu.

##i have contacted motorola with the issue i am having with my phone.
##if the phone is used alot it gets hot easily and the screen will start shaking and sometimes the phone will start texting an o or any other alphabetic character.
##very upsetting.
##sometimes i can't get the phone to unlock and since you can't take the battery out you hold the off button until the phone shuts off.
##sometimes this happens multiple times a day.
[t]HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
##i had usage from this phone for 4 weeks after that it shut down completely, unable to make or receives calls etc.
##it is quite disturbing to know i took my  my money to purchased this phone.

##i just replaced this phone and had it for a year.
##i think it is a "fake phone."
##it has numerous software problems.
##it looks good though; your friends will know that you are in the smartphone world.
##the real problem is the software was faulty from start to finish despite numerous updates and upgrades.
##it would randomly come on and start "butt-dialing" the person you knew the least of anyone in your address book.
##i talked to former acquaintances that i had avoided for years - on purpose- but my moto g4 didn't care.
##seriously.
##this is a junky phone.
##buy a samsung, or if you have a good job ,get an iphone, or go back to the crack phone if this is your only choice.
[t]Moto G4 XT1621 Dual SIM awesome!
##this phone has impressed me.
##easy to setup and use.
##dual sim is nice to have.
##if not wanting to carry 2 phones, then take sim out of other phone and install into this phone.
##also nice to have when travel.
##i have t-mobile and could use there text and data in indonesia, yet had indonesian sim for calls and text.
##when went on trip with friend to florida from ohio,, i slapped in his sim and we could use the car's bluetooth for 1 phone yet 2 lines.
##easy to remove cover to add/remove sim or sd on the fly.
##very pleased for price.
