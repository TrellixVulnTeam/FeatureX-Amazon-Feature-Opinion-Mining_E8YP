No frills, GPS works, slow charger included, battery lasts for days standby","A good phone for the near hundred dollar price point.  I received one that was a Verizon version according to the firmware, but it was unlocked and still works fine for AT&T towers via Tracfone.  GPS works fine with this one, but leaving it on all the time will drain your battery faster.  1A included charger is slow, but will charge faster with a 2A car charger etc.  Standby lasts for several days if you only make a couple calls a day.  This is my second one because I broke the screen on the first after about a year and couldn't be without one for the week waiting for the new screen.  This time I bought a better screen protector, so maybe it will last more than a year this time.

I use it for calling, texting, and such and sometimes for light games. All I will say is that it is a fast and reliable for light use that I got when the price was like $104 so I am so happy I bought it then. My Alcatel Pixi Unite sucked and hardly lasted a year with considerably light usage.<br /><br />The glass is hard to get fingerprints on, by the way, and it's is a sturdy construction (if you drop your phone, the case will stay on because it has clips all around the interior of the back panel). For those looking to use this phone with TracFone like me, PLEASE REMEMBER that this is a GSM unlocked, not CMDA. Do NOT try to switch the SIM from your old phone to your new phone because TracFone deals out service according to the... IMEI, or serial number, something like that. They have to manually switch service from your old phone to the new phone using a NEW SIM from the BYOP pack ($10ish at WalMart), it will take half an hour to an hour for all the verification to complete so make sure you have time. If you give TracFone the Verizon SIM # in the BYOP pack (should be the last one in the red), they will tell you the phone is not compatible (especially if that person is talking to you late at night and really wants to go home, and will give you no further explanation or help other than ""the phone is not compatible""). Notify them immediately that your phone is GMS unlocked and they will help your from there, you have to use the ATT or T-Mobile SIM in the BYOP pack (I literally had to call the next day when they opened back up since they closed before I could call again, and I made sure to tell the man EVERYTHING i could about the phone to avoid further... unnecessary setbacks).<br /><br />Also, when I got the phone, it stated in the settings that it's service is Verizon. Do not let that fool you, Verizon is a CMDA carrier so it is a misnomer. If neither ATT or T-Mobile work with the phone (try the other if one won't work to be certain), consider that the phone might not be unlocked due to whatever occurrence and return it for another to see if a replacement will work (make sure you keep all the packaging until you verify that the phone service works).",5,positive

All the errors that users of a particular phone I've owned  have reported, I've managed to avoid. That is until I pre-ordered the Moto G4.<br /><br />The first few months of owning the G4 were perfect. It was much faster than my former Motorola Razr Maxx HD, and the screen was beautiful. A few months in, the phone started to have issues with ghost touching. The random dialing was a major issue. The ghost touching also affected the lockscreen to my annoyance, as it kept pressing one of dots on the pattern over and over and wouldn't let up until I put my phone to sleep. The phone also would randomly die if I called someone, watched a video, or used the GPS. If I turned the phone back on, I would find that the battery had drained down to 1%.<br /><br />The support at Lenovo was horrendous. There were several posts at the forums from users with the same issues that I've had, and the support techs seem to only answer with, ""all phone models deal with random shut downs."" I had the option to send the phone in for repair/replacement, but I had dealt with this phone for over a year and I desperately needed a phone to work correctly. I bit the bullet and bought a much pricier phone that has worked much better  than the G4 ever did. It's really such a shame as I've had two Motorola phones in the past, and I've never encountered such terrible issues that makes a phone practically useless.",1,negative

B079SGQNPN,"on December 3, 2017",amzn1.account.AGI5ORBMJ6QRIISO4TC2FVZKBKXA,"Started off good, but now some issues","Update:<br /><br />Since my initial review, the phone started experiencing ghost touch or flickering issues.  Even just trying to unlock the phone or shut it down became a chore sometimes.  Other reviewers have reported the same thing.  There are YouTube videos that claim to help you fix this.  I looked at those and tried several ways to fix it, all to no avail.  I read that if you adjust the adaptive brightness controls, that should fix it.  No.  Finally, I read online that one way you can fix this issue is to switch this to developer mode and select the developer option that tells the GPU to manage the screen composition.  It was also suggested that you download the Eye Filter app from the Play Store and set the black colors to 4% opacity.  None of this worked for the long haul.  The only thing that seems to work so far is to turn down the screen brightness all the way.  You can still see it indoors or in dark settings, though bright sunlight may be a challenge.  So far I've had no issues when the screen brightness is turned way down.  The only caveat is that you may not want to continually use the phone at minimum brightness.  Even turning up the level to midway will set off the flickering again.  In the. meantime, I've noticed some orange-yellowish tint on the upper right hand side of the screen - possible burn-in issue.  I also can't get the SD card reader to work correctly.  In more ways than one, this budget phone is showing why it's a budget phone.  This was a four-star review. Sadly I have to cut it down to 3.<br /><br />I bought the Moto G4 at Best Buy in the spring of 2017.  I usually do a lot of research before buying an electronic device, but I had to make an unusually quick decision given that my previous phone, the Moto X (2nd Edition/2014) experienced a faulty charging port.  I did not have time to send it back to Motorola and besides, it was out of warranty since I had owned it for nearly a year and a half when the charging port failed.  Note to self, ""be extra careful each time you plug in to charge; not that this is guaranteed to prevent port failure).  I was a bit weary about buying another Moto phone, as I was afraid a similar problem may occur with subsequent Moto devices.  However, for the price I paid (about $135; or $165 when I added in a 2 year protection/replacement plan at Best Buy), I rolled the dice on the Moto G4.  I did not realize there was a Plus version with a better camera and a fingerprint sensor when I bought the G4 - and when I purchased it, it was at the same time that the Moto G5 Plus came out.  Having already purchased the Moto G4, it made no sense to return it and to get a different phone until I gave it a real college try.  With the little bit of research I was able to do, I reasoned that the Moto G4 might be okay.  I did not love that it came with only 16 GB of storage, but unlike my Moto X (2nd Gen), the Moto G4 came with a micro SD card slot for expandable memory. Except for the fact that the phone did not have that nice distinctive curved back like my previous one, I liked that it was just as thin and almost as light in the hand.  I liked the slightly taller 5.5 inch profile, which wasn't any harder to operate than the previous 5.2 incher.  Due to the slightly larger dimensions, I lost about 23 pixels per inch on the resolution and I was disappointed that I had to give up the nice AMOLED screen for the IPS display.  That said, this Moto G4 has almost as nice a display as the Moto X, especially when you turn on vibrant colors.  I miss the Moto Voice feature that I had with the Moto X.  I loved being able to just talk to the phone without having to pick it up.  While you can use Google Voice to perform many of the same functions, it only works if you have the phone turned on.  If it is in the off position, it won't work.  I do like that you can still twist to turn on the camera and do the chop chop action to turn on the LED light.  Also, you have a bigger battery with the Moto G4 (3,000 mAh vs. just 2300).  The phone provides an almost stock Android experience.  It came with Android Marshmallow and I upgraded to Nougat.  I'm not sure if it will get Oreo, but if it does, it will be a while. For a while, I noticed some of the ghost touching issues others have reported.  But I recently installed some updates and that seems to have fixed the issue.  We'll see if that lasts.  The processing speed seems good and again, with the update, things seem really quick and buttery smooth, especially over wifi.  I'm on T-Mobile and if I go over my 4G LTE high speed data limit, I do notice the throttled speeds when online.  You definitely want to get some kind of case for this, because it does scratch easily, especially along the sides.  It picks up dents and dings easily if dropped. However, I've dropped this thing a few times (and some were big drops without a case) and the screen took it like a champ.  The camera is so-so.  Nothing to write home about, but it does have some manual mode controls that allow you to maximize your image quality.  Low light conditions are a struggle, though.  For your average photo to share online, via text, or email, it is more than sufficient.  So long as you know that you are buying a budget device and that you are not getting top of the line specs, you should be pleased with this phone.  This is my sixth smart phone - and I've had the iPhone as well as Samsungs - and I don't think I've found a perfect device yet.  I also don't see the point to ever spend more than about $300 for a phone - and if you can spend less for something just as good at the $300 price point or higher, even better.  I was a bit wary about buying another Moto after what happened to my Moto X, but for the price, I've owned this phone for going on 8 months now and so far I'm reasonably satisfied.  It does what it needs to do.  It takes ok pictures, is quite speedy, the volume and call reception is good (in fact, T-Mobile seems to have improved its reception in my area in just the past few months), has a nice screen that isn't hard to look at, and the battery has generally gotten me through at least a full day, sometimes into the next day.  I could have returned this, spent more, and got a higher end phone, but you never know what trade-offs you will end up having to settle for.",3,negative

I'm not an android user daily but this phone has plenty of capability and using a foreign sim card was very easy. It's dual sim'd so I have a US sim as well and that was easy to setup as well. Good phone for the price.,4,positive

Most recently a Nexus 6, which I lost, replaced by a LG G4 which ended up bricked.  So I bought this budget Android not expecting too much really.  I've had other budget androids including ZTE, LG, Samsung etc.<br /><br />This is one of the best phones I've ever purchased.  Hands down better device than the G4 at a 1/4 of the price.  I cannot tell you how happy I am with it.  I would have to seriously consider whether to use my Nexus 6 if I were to find it.  Unlocked out of the box with no extra ads of any kind.  No carrier ads, no packaged/bundled useless software, etc.  It is straight up Android (upgrading automatically to Android 7 out of the box) and it works perfectly.<br /><br />I would give this phone 10 stars if I could based on value relative to price.  It is 10 times the quality of anything put out by BLU.",5,positive

If the phone is used alot it gets hot easily and the screen will start shaking and sometimes the phone will start texting an o or any other alphabetic character.  Very upsetting.  Sometimes I can't get the phone to unlock and since you can't take the battery out you hold the off button until the phone shuts off.  Sometimes this happens multiple times a day.,1,negative

I think it is a ""fake phone.""  It has numerous software problems. It looks good though; your friends will know that you are in the smartphone world.  The real problem is the software was faulty from start to finish despite numerous updates and upgrades. It would randomly come on and start ""butt-dialing"" the person you knew the least of anyone in your address book.  I talked to former acquaintances that I had avoided for years - on purpose- but my Moto G4 didn't care.<br /><br />Seriously.  This is a junky phone. Buy a Samsung, or if you have a good job ,get an iPhone, or go back to the crack phone if this is your only choice.",1,negative

If not wanting to carry 2 phones, then take sim out of other phone and install into this phone. Also nice to have when travel. I have T-Mobile and could use there text and data in Indonesia, yet had Indonesian sim for calls and text. When went on trip with friend to Florida from Ohio,, I slapped in his sim and we could use the car's Bluetooth for 1 phone yet 2 lines. Easy to remove cover to add/remove sim or SD on the fly.
