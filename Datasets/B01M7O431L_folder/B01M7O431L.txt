##i replaced my lg g6 with the samsung s7 edge since the lg would not hold a charge anymore.
##that is the one thing i dislike about the new generation of phones.
##the samsung is fast, light and has great graphics.
##just put my verizon sim card in it after the initial start-up and and it worked.
##did not have to contact verizon.
##they were able to get all the info about the samsung to change my number over to it.
##very easy.
##so far so good.
##re-certified is the way to go.
[t]its screwd that ya left the only stupid way i can put a sim card in. sad i need a key to a phone.
##its screwd that ya left the only stupid way i can put a sim card in.. wheres the silly little key that everyones gonna lose?.
##the phone works good folks but the way they made it is the dumbest thing i ever seen,.. its a hassle already cause when they made the dang phone, why the heck should i even need a key for a dang phone.
##now when you lose this ever easy to lose key, u cant even get top your sim care or memory card.
##why not keep phones simple, what happened to removing the back.
##this is a way to make more money off of ppl because they know u will lose that little crap.
##its ashamed that if something happens to this phone and u need to remove the sim card.. your screwed just cause you dnt have a darn key... i could just strangle greedy ppl wwho make ish like this mann come on.
##now we need keys for our phones???
##this phone  is inconvient or how ever u spell the stupid word.
##im so pissed that i  aint about to try to spell it right.
##shame who ever made this phone and thought makin ppl keep iup with a damn key, was a good idea and i would love to tlk to them.. if i gotta have a key to open my phone.
##keys should be free.
##cause takinig the back off of my phone all my life was free.
##i wont pay for these keys.
[t]Phone was lagging like crazy and would not respond in numerous occasions
##phone was lagging like crazy and would not respond in numerous occasions.

##i' so sorry i purchased this for her :(
[t]To many bad reviews.

[t]Great Phone...if you get one that works.
##this is my 3rd phone from this seller in less than a month.
##the first one i received was in excellent physical condition and worked great until the fingerprint scanner stopped working on day 3. called support, "hardware issue", had to return.
##second phone was also in great physical condition but was missing factory apps that cannot be downloaded.
##called support again.
##they contacted samsung and verizon and said software was not factory, "possibly tampered with or counterfeit phone."
##returned.
##third phone  arrived in less than great condition physically.
##scratches on back and a small dark spot on the lower left hand corner of screen but everything seems to work ok. success!
##or so i thought.
##a couple weeks later, battery isn't holding charge nearly as well as first two phones.
##it's not horrible but i know firsthand what it should be and it's not living up.
##i don't want the hassle of returning again but i'm not pleased at all with dealfisher.

##there is nothing wrong with this phone, once i got it in the mail i got my old phone took the straight talk sim card out and then popped it into the s7 edge and it automatically started working.
[t]Love the phone, Verizon not so much though.
##ordered to replace a samsung galaxy s4.
##it arrived the next day as promised.
##the box was a generic box that looked sort of used however the phone inside was wrapped in a protective film with a generic cable and charger.
##the description of the phone did clearly say the original accessories would not necessarily be included.
##when i removed the protective film on the phone i checked carefully for damage or scratches and there were none.
##it looked like a new unused cell phone.
##the battery we partly charged so i plugged it in to charge it fully which it did without issue.
##the only issue i ran into was when i tried to secure a new sim card.
##my s4 used a micro sim and the s7 needs a nano sim.
##i had to visit 4 verizon locations to get the new card.
##it seems that verizon vendors, which they have on every corner here, have little to no experience with this issue.
##one vender refused period, the second didn't have the card and the third installed an incorrect card and when they called a verizon tech about it he told them the card was ok but it would take 5 days for the phone to be activated.
##as a telco retiree i knew there was a problem but it wasn't the phone.
##after a call to the company, on my 4th visit to a verizon location, i was finally able to secure the correct card and it was connected in minutes.
##so far this phone is awesome.
##there are bells and whistles that i am still trying to get used to but i am happy with my purchase.
##hopefully that will continue to be the case.
##i mention the issues with the card because i can see where my contacts with this provider could throw doubt on this purchase for others.

##update: had the phone just under a month and the rear camera started malfunctioning but would still work, then just under 2 month mark it consistently fails to start up.
##unfortunately this seems to be a common problem with galaxy phones, however, i tried practically every solution available but no luck.
##was told its probably a hardware issue if a factory reset failed to fix the issue.

[t]How new is this phone? Battery dies everyday quickly
##my biggest concern is  that the battery  drains very quickly and dies  before a single day is out with little use and the warranty.
##is only what 90 days ?
##i will be contacting the reseller about this  as it is getting worse by the day  :-(  also sadly this is not truly an "unlocked" phone.
##it is unlocked enough to use another carrier's sim card , but it is full of verizon bloatware and has many errors that at&t and other carriers cannot work around because it was a verizon phone.
##you cannot make a phone call or return one or use the voice mail anything like that unless you dial the whole number from a contact not from your history these are all verizon bloatware issues not this seller it is just not made clear unfortunately this is a problem you will have to put up with.
##when i bought my first unlocked motorola droid it was truly unlocked with no carriers bloatware and i found it much faster and certainly fully functional.

##last time i bought a refurbished phone (not from this company) it was an s5.
##the first one i got seemed fine...except it wouldn't accept my sim card.
##so it was completely useless as, you know, a phone.
##i returned it for a new one, and this time i got one with a broken headphone jack (which i didn't care too much about) and the phone was unable to tell when i tried to put it into landscape mode.
##i decided just to not bother anymore, and keep it.
##with this phone, i checked over everything.
##orientation, camera, sim and sd card, apps, mic, speaker, jack, usb, battery life--everything i thought could go wrong.
##everything seemed perfectly in order.

##the cell phone is very good, but the late delivery almost makes me miss the flight.
[t]Great phone, like new and only two minor issues.
##the phone arrived in almost new condition and appears to work just fine.
##i have had it for about two weeks.
##there were two minor issues that aren't a huge deal in my opinion.
##the first is the charger, i don't believe i was supposed to get a samsung charger but the one that shipped with the phone is an off brand that did not charge very fast, like 10% in one hour.
##i switched the charger to one of my older samsung chargers and it charged much faster and completed the charge in a couple of hours.
##the second issue is that the sim card for the s7 edge is smaller than the one for my s5.
##if you go to a verizon store (not an independent store) they will change it out for free which is what i did.
##again not a huge deal, i may not have noticed  if they mentioned it so it is fine.
##all in all it sure beats paying the price for a new phone.

##everything works right off the bat besides mobile data, this is due to the phone having the apn for verizon still being used in the settings; but this is an easy fix just look up your carrier apn for that model of phone and add it into your settings and viola, everything works perfectly.

[t]The phone that I always wanted :)
##i sincerely hope you take the time to read this review and hope it is helpful because i am going in depth with my experience with this phone and other tips to help you out.
##this phone is indeed gsm unlocked although it is a verizon phone with its logo.
##any network carrier will work through this phone, but there are special, crucial steps to do so (i will explain it more later on below about third party sellers).
##so first thing is about the phone itself.
##i received this phone and i was actually excited and surprised at how good of a condition it was.
##i hardly if not see any damages, it's clean, smooth, and what an s7 edge should be as new.
##so already off to a great start.
##charger and adapter can with it.
##and boy does this phone charges fast, and the charger helps as well and neat charging animation (even gives an estimate time).
##they are clean as well and works great.
##so far, i have not had an issue wirh this phone heating up when not charging (suppose to heat up a little in the back when it is), so that is a good sign.
##remember this phone uses a micro usb cable.
##also came along was a sim card opener.
##very useful so that i don't need to use a pin and possibly damage anything you know?
##this phone uses a micro sim card, not the regular sim.
##so if you don't have one, ask your carrier's store if you have those triple sim card where the micro sim is in there so you can insert the card in.
##also, same place as the sim is where you can place the micro sd card as well.
##useful for the extra storage.
##what i am disappointed is that it did not came with a usb connector, which helps transfer files between and especially when you want to transfer via smart switch app already pre-installed in the phone, and others as printing and etc.
##just be prepared to wait perhaps hours if you have a lot of things to transfer from your old phone.
##i recommend using smart switch app because it transfers everything from your old phone and lets you control which ones to transfer too.
##you can also transfer wirelessly as well.
##you just need to open the app on the old phone and click the three dots upper right to open settings and the pin is there to use in the transfer process.
##so when you first start the phone, you will go through the steps to set the phone up.
##don't worry about the sim card insert or mobile data.
##you can do this later.
##right now you want to get to the home screen.
##once you are done, scroll around and see how the phone looks.
##since this is a verizon, you will see their apps.
##you don't have to use them, like the verizon messaging is cool looking, but sucks when it does not have an organized contacts tab (not alphabetized), instead from the last person you contacted and you can't even search them up.
##the phone is already updated, and personally, everything about the s7 edge is an uprgrade for me from my s5.
##the phone i received looks good and performs good.
##i have not yet had an issue with it.
##so now when you insert the sim card, you will not automatically get your carrier data.
##this is where the special instructions begin, and i go more about this later on.
##what you do see is the notification that this is not a verizon sim card.
##you can easily clear this out or even force stop it by long tapping it, app info, and force stop it.
##but this will always reappear everyone you restart the phone.
##but honestly, this does not even bother me and just minor compared to how awesome the phone will be once i can get it to work under my data plan.
##i recommend backing up as i mentioned before after you get your data to work because what if you have problems with the phone?
##and your backup is installed in there and you then need to transfer back to your old phone or computer.
##so let me tell you that finding this samsung galaxy s7 "edge" is such a chore especially when you are searching for one with affordable pricing, color, and one that should be unlocked.
##i had to buy a refurbished phone because it is always cheaper and sometimes in a good scenario, all that happened to it was that it was "used" or opened from the box.
##if you are buying a phone online, you must definitely do your research on whoever selling it and what the descriptions and return policies say.
##i bought this phone from seller buyspry.
##previously, i had bought it from another seller.
##sometimes, these phones are not directly from samsung or amazon, but is backed by amazon and from certified refurbished third party sellers.
##so if anything goes wrong, you can count on amazon having your back and that you can contact the seller as well.
##and that is exactly what happened to me and i did.
##you see, i highly suggest keep in contact with whoever selling the phone and emailing them directly making sure you get instructions and the information needed to unlock your phone.
##they emailed me first with a link saying verizon guarantees never to lock their phones and provided a youtube link to unlocking the phone.
##to be frankly honest, i don't think the video helps too much for me lol, although i watched through it.
##because, the real info you need all comes down to the phone's network settings where you need to input things as apn, proxy, etc.
##if you are confused in what to do to get your data network activated, it is best to first go to the carrier's store.
##i have metero pcs, and i was extremely lucky to have an employee there generously (btw, 15 bucks now to activate the phone to have it work under metro pcs lol) help me out input the information for me.
##also, not only that, you also need additional input for mms to work.
##because the information provided is not enough (which i included) for metero pcs, you need to give them the imei number for the phone.
##this is what i know only for metro.
##i can't say for other carriers, but i could imagine it is all similar.
##after all that, i think you should be able to back up and then customize as you please.
##also to point out, this phone has the function to show the clock when it is locked/turned off.
##this can get annoying and to mention waste of battery.
##you can easily disable this feature by going to settings, display and turn off always on display.
##so i hope you read to the end and that is this review helped you.
##i want you able to enjoy the new phone as i have and hope things go smoothly

##i love the near-pristine condition of the phone and it's all round functionality.

##my one complaint is the scuffing / scratch on the display.
##there are a few small, yet noticeable areas of damage on the display.

[t]Great price, great phone!
##bought this phone a few days ago, setting up was easy, just connect to wi-fi and update all apps, after that just called metro pcs and set up my new phone with existing sim.
##i was using iphone for 4 years in the past, i should say that so far i'm loving my new phone, i don't miss iphone and even better, i love the fact that i spent like 1/3rd the price of an expensive brand new phone.
[t]Great Samsung phones keep getting better.
##great improvement over my s5.
##of course my s5 was a great improvement over my s3.
##been with samsung for the last 3 phones.
##like the big screen and feel of the phone.
##don't think i would want to go any bigger.
##as for the edge thing, really don't use it so probably not necessary.
[t]Refurbished device gamble paid off!
##i am so happy with this phone.
##i was a bit uneasy about buying a refurbished device, but my galaxy note 4 was broken, and i really did not want to shell out nearly $1k for the note 8. so i figured i would try this refurbished s7 edge and hope it would last long enough for the price to go down on the note 8.  this phone looks and works like brand new!
##i was able to contact verizon and have them switch over to this device with no problems.
##about 24 hours after activating it, the phone did go through about 15 different software updates to bring it up to date, but i was expecting this to happen.
##after all the updates were finished, i did a quick wipe of the cache partition, and the phone has been working great.
##the package includes an adaptor for connecting to your old samsung galaxy phone to transfer all of your apps and data.
##i had all of my music on an sd card in my note 4, and was able to move the card into the s7 edge with no problems.
##the phone did not come with the little tool for opening the sd/sim card slot, but i just used the post of an earring to easily open it (you can also just use a paperclip or a thumbtack).
##i've been using the phone for 2 weeks now, and all of the functions work flawlessly - calls, texts, apps, bluetooth connectivity, everything.
##i had originally planned to only use this phone for a year or so, but i like it so much, i hope it lasts longer.
##one of my concerns with a refurbished device, especially one with a non-removable battery (the back of this particular phone does not easily pop open without specialized tools) was that the battery would already be old and would quickly die.
##i am happy to report that the battery in the phone that i received lasts a really long time.
##it would probably last several days in standby/light usage, and it easily lasts a day and half for me with heavy usage and lots of video streaming.
##it comes with a samsung fast charging cable, and i have subsequently purchased the samsung wireless charger to charge it wirelessly, and that works perfectly, too.
##if you are hesitating for the same reasons i was, i can recommend this device with no reservations.
[t]I don't know what the future holds but for now this is an amazing product!
##got it about two weeks now and it works perfectly!

[t]Don't waste your time and money

##so all was well for the first month i think.
##i did notice right away that the phone would get really hot after charging it.
##i recently noticed the backing of my phone was sticking out so i figured maybe i dropped it and it popped open so i just pushed it closed and the back glass broke... i couldnt figure out why it was not closing or even open in the first place.
##then i started to notice my battery life draining fast even on battery save mode.
##i have to charge this thing 2 to 3 times a day.
##(it does charge fast though) i soon realized it was the battery.
##it was swollen.
##idk when or how it happened i didnt do anything unusual.
##its winter and when i walk to work its cold outside so it couldnt have over heated.. i just dont know but now i need a new battery and a new back glass cover.
##im very disappointed!!

[t]... and I got convinced that I was receiving a good product. Well
##i think i read every single review on this item before i purchased it and i got convinced that i was receiving a good product.
##well, i have received the phone a day later than expected, not big deal.. i was anxious to get it since my old phone is having issues.
##unfortunately, the phone has two dark dots on the screen and when i try to activate it, it tells me that it's not able to do so.
##luckily the phone comes with the seller's contact info.. i left a voice message and sent an email.. of course it's friday, so probably i won't hear from them until monday.
##i'm already working on returning it.. i hope it's not a difficult process because i have no time for it :( bad, bad experience.
##i hope the seller gets back to me soon enough.. if he could replace it with a good working phone i will update you all.

[t]SERIOUS Battery Expansion Problem
##before you buy this... don't.
##this phone has a battery expansion problem.
##basically, your battery swells up and separates the backing off of the phone.
##samsung knows about this, but doesn't do anything about it, which sucks.
##if you don't believe me, google "s7 edge battery swelling/expanding" and you'll see many people that have the same problem.
##if you do get this phone, i hope you're one of the lucky ones that this doesn't happen to.

##and this isn't a simple two-second screen freeze and it doesn't do it again for another hour or so.
##this is constant screen flashing in and out, apps are opened without him touching them, he can't send texts or messages without other things being sent that he never touches.
##he can't use the phone without something going wrong with it.

##to counterbalance that though, it charges really quickly.
##another possibly complaint is the edge itself, after a while you'll get used to gripping it differently, and if you get the spigen case it makes it even easier to grip, but the edge looks really nice, so it's really your choice there, whether you want to edge or not.

##great condition, product came as described.
##unlocked verizon phone...nicely packaged with a charger.
[t]good phone not so good charger.
##the phone is good but the charger broke on me in about a week, id suggest getting another charger with the purchase of this phone.
[t]It seems I have a hot pan instead a phone
##the product has arrived in great condition overall but the reason why i'm giving 3 stars is just the battery life: i've disconnected the phone with 100% about 4:00 pm, 6-8 hours after, the phone needs to be charge again.
##this is a 3600 mah battery, the battery should be ok about 1 day at least.
##plus, the temperature of the phone when you update it or play a game is high, i've had to stop when i play or when i update the phone (i don't know if with a battery replacement, the phone will be ok).
##i've buy it throught tech venture and the charger that arrived with the phone was an 1 a charger: totally useless.
##i'm charging the phone with a 2 a charger without fast charging but i've desactivated the "fast charge mode" first.
##they have sent to me the quad-core (qualcomm) version, before you place the order, you should to ask the seller.
##my advice: ask the seller first and if they are not able to take your doubts away, do not buy it.
##i'd like to return the phone but i'm not in the country right now and that's not easy for me.

[t]Perfectly adequate replacement for a used phone
##this product is exactly what i expected.
##it has several minor scratches and the battery life is very slightly shorter than a new phone, but (so far at least) it runs fine and has fine battery life.
##it seems comparable to my old phone, which i broke by dropping it (hence the need for a replacement).
##i am not sure that i would buy this as a new phone, but as a replacement for a used phone at a reasonable price it does just fine.
[t]Straight Talk seems to not work on this phone..
##not 100% yet, seems to lose service yet still trying to figure out if it's the phone or the service because i never had trouble with past phones... i'm starting to think i need to return the phone...

##the cellphone is ok, works good but unfortunate the sealer never told me that on the screen the cellphone has a pink line across and there is nothing i can do, i decided to take it to a cellphone store and to get that fix i would need to pay over $150.00 not happy with this purchase i don't recommend refurnished products
[t]Beautiful phone! Great purchase!
##i was pleasantly surprised when i received my phone, it looked brand new.
##no scratches, screen was in perfect condition.
##i switched my straight talk sim card to this phone and had no issues what so ever.
##ive had the phone since feb and its now early april, i waited to review this phone so i could make sure of how it would operate.
##so far its had one little minor hiccup that has fixed itself.
##i am extremely pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy from this seller again.
[t]Buyer beware: faulty screens, 0 help from Samsung.
##after a few months of owning the phone a small purple line popped up on the right side of the screen.
##i called samsung, the employee on the phone apparently deals with this a lot, she informed me my warranty just expired and after some research online, i find out this is a 300 dollar fix (new digitizer) and you are almost guaranteed to have this line when you buy a s7 edge.
##all you have to do is research the purple line problem for s7 edge on google.
##the most promising fix you can do at home, you can't even do with a verizon phone because they lock the secret codes.
##the phone itself works great, feels great.
##expect this purple line down the screen though.
##it's a shame they don't stand by their products and fix their mistakes.

##i would not recommend.
##although, yes it is a very nice phone.
##i love the resolution and everything about it.
##it is not worth it.
##obviously the biggest thing about the edge are the edges.
##unfortunately about this, the edges are exposed.
##i only had mine for a month until it dropped a foot and the edge of the screen cracked,  and i couldn't see the bottom half of my phone.
##nice phone, but not practical.
##i wish i would have gotten the note instead.
##it is not worth the risk of cracking and damaging.
##the cost to repair is the same as as much as you pay for the phone.
[t]Purchased refurbished phone
##after much research and reading customer reviews i bought the s7 edge in silver.
##i was really apprehensive about it from reading the negative reviews.
##i was really surprised how nice the phone was when received.
##i am a quality inspector, 30 yrs., and put my experienced eye on it.
##the only blemish i could find was a couple minute scratches near the usb port.
##i read bad reviews from people who said the phones didn't work.
##the wife has the same exact phone so i borrowed her sim card.
##turned it on and it fired right up, connected to the network.
##everything worked as is should.
##display is beautiful, clear and sharp.
##i've only had it for 3 days so i can't comment on breakdowns.

[t]This phone is not what it is claimed as being.  Be wary!
##although this was posted as a certified refurbished verizon unlocked phone, it isn't actually a verizon phone.
##even the case is stamped verizon.
##after spending three hours with verizon customer support trying to determine why verizon voicemail wasn't on the phone, they informed me that verizon voicemail is specific to a verizon phone since it is a pre-installed system app from verizon.
##a complete factory reset of the phone was done twice, without the verizon apps being restored.
##the verizon system apps cannot be downloaded from google play.
##as such, i'm stuck with the phone.
##also, amazon claims that i returned the phone and that a credit was issued to my account.
##not true.
##i still have the phone and a credit was never issued.
##this confusion continued with amazon customer service.
[t]I think I just received a bad piece that turned out to be a lemon

##you don't want to pay for full priced new phones.
##you get what you get quit complaining people.
[t]Great phone, has bloatware
##i love this phone.
##i'm coming from an iphone 6. my reason from switching is that i don't believe apple has been innovative since steve jobs passed away.
##they also throttled my phone to get a new one.
##so i did - a galaxy.
##the reason for 4 stars is that this phone is claimed unlocked.
##i was under the impression, despite reading reviews, that it would also mean that the verizon bloatware would be removed.
##it was not, so be warned that you'll have it on your phone.
##i use a phone service called mint, which is a gsm carrier.
##this does work on this phone.
##you'll have to play with the settings but it'll get there.
##the phone is in perfect, new condition.
##no scratches at all.
##i would definitely recommend anyone to buy from this company and buy this product.

[t]Very nice phone even 2 years after it's first release
##i'm not a huge fan of samsung phones due to their bloatwares, but i have to admit it is hard not to be satisfied with the camera and display of this phone even by today's standards.
##i love the fact that samsung is still offering analog headphone jack.
##my major complains are: 1. phone is very hard to hold for extended length of time due to its curved edged, if you aren't using a case.
##2. my phone's finger print reader is lagging and not very accurate.
##it fails about 50% of the time.
##i've registered my fingers 3 times so far, no change.
##3. samsung and verizon's useless apps take lots of memory and storage and slowdown the boot up time.
##4. speaker is very mediocre.
##5.
##"back" and "menu/ current app" buttons are the opposite of other android devices.

##i bought this phone and it was fine for about 2 o 3 weeks before it started to malfunction.
##the phone would start itself when opening certain apps like netflix, but that was just the beginning.
##after about a month and a half after i bought it the phone went completely crazy, it would shut off randomly without it even being used, it would spend entire days and nights restarting itself over and over again.
##i took it to be fixed after one night it just stopped working entirely.
##i took it to get fixed, but i was told that there was nothing that could be done so now the phone sits in a drawer after a couple months of using it.

##you have to manually update the internet connection.

##also, for voicemail, you have to go into the call settings and change the voicemail from *86 to your phone number or it'll say you are calling an international number.
##other than that, the phone is perfect.
##the packaging was a little mashed up, but the box doesn't affect how i use it.
##the camera is amazing!!
##it's fast as far as using apps, but it's slow to charge and the battery life isn't the best but for what it is and the price, i couldn't be happier.
##so if you use cricket, this phone will work!
##hope that helps!
