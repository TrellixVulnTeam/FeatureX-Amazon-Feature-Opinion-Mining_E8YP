Did not have to contact Verizon.  They were able to get all the info about the Samsung to change my number over to it. Very easy. So far so good. Re-certified is the way to go.",5,positive

Second phone was also in great physical condition but was missing factory apps that cannot be downloaded. Called support again. They contacted Samsung and Verizon and said software was not factory, ""possibly tampered with or counterfeit phone."" Returned. Third phone  arrived in less than great condition physically. Scratches on back and a small dark spot on the lower left hand corner of screen but everything seems to work ok. SUCCESS! Or so I thought.

The box was a generic box that looked sort of used however the phone inside was wrapped in a protective film with a generic cable and charger. The description of the phone did clearly say the original accessories would not necessarily be included. When I removed the protective film on the phone I checked carefully for damage or scratches and there were none. It looked like a new unused cell phone. The battery we partly charged so I plugged it in to charge it fully which it did without issue. The only issue I ran into was when I tried to secure a new SIM card. My S4 used a micro SIM and the S7 needs a nano SIM. I had to visit 4 Verizon locations to get the new card. It seems that Verizon vendors, which they have on every corner here, have little to no experience with this issue. One vender refused period, the second didn't have the card and the third installed an incorrect card and when they called a Verizon tech about it he told them the card was ok but it would take 5 days for the phone to be activated.  As a Telco retiree I knew there was a problem but it wasn't the phone. After a call to the company, on my 4th visit to a Verizon location, I was finally able to secure the correct card and it was connected in minutes. So far this phone is awesome.  There are bells and whistles that I am still trying to get used to but I am happy with my purchase. Hopefully that will continue to be the case.  I mention the issues with the card because I can see where my contacts with this provider could throw doubt on this purchase for others.",5,positive

I will be contacting the reseller about this  as it is getting worse by the day  :-(  also sadly this is not truly an ""unlocked"" phone. It is unlocked enough to use another carrier's SIM card , but it is full of Verizon bloatware and has many errors that AT&T and other carriers cannot work around because it was a Verizon phone. You cannot make a phone call or return one or use the voice mail anything like that unless you dial the whole number from a contact not from your history these are all Verizon bloatware issues not this seller it is just not made clear unfortunately this is a problem you will have to put up with.

But when I got the S7, I didn't know what I was in for.  Right off the bat, it just felt different in my hand - I didn't like it.  Then months after I had it, the problems started.  It would shut down or restart on its own, it was slow and unresponsive at times.  Checked for viruses and malware.  Always came up clean.  So I called Verizon, they couldn't fix it over the phone, so they sent a replacement.  Well,  that replacement wouldn't even activate.  The Verizon people were stumped and they ended up sending me another replacement to replace my replacement.  Maybe it's just bad luck on my part, but I never had any problems with the other Galaxies.  I really don't like this phone and I'll soon be replacing it.  Hopefully, Samsung got their stuff together on the S9+.  Hopefully, that's my next one.<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying this model, caveat emptor, buyer beware.

I have had it for about two weeks. There were two minor issues that aren't a huge deal in my opinion. The first is the charger, I don't believe I was supposed to get a Samsung charger but the one that shipped with the phone is an off brand that did not charge very fast, like 10% in one hour. I switched the charger to one of my older Samsung chargers and it charged much faster and completed the charge in a couple of hours. The second issue is that the SIM card for the S7 Edge is smaller than the one for my S5. If you go to a Verizon store (not an independent store) they will change it out for free which is what I did.

B01M7O431L,"on January 2, 2018",amzn1.account.AHBGGVSYMKKFZQ5I4FSQ5J57OW4A,The phone that I always wanted :),"I sincerely hope you take the time to read this review and hope it is helpful because I am going in depth with my experience with this phone and other tips to help you out.<br /><br />This phone is indeed GSM unlocked although it is a Verizon phone with its logo. Any network carrier will work through this phone, but there are special, crucial steps to do so (I will explain it more later on below about third party sellers).<br /><br />So first thing is about the phone itself. I received this phone and I was actually excited and surprised at how good of a condition it was. I hardly if not see any damages, it's clean, smooth, and what an S7 Edge should be as new. So already off to a great start.<br />Charger and adapter can with it. And boy does this phone charges fast, and the charger helps as well and neat charging animation (even gives an estimate time). They are clean as well and works great. So far, I have not had an issue wirh this phone heating up when NOT charging (suppose to heat up a little in the back when it is), so that is a good sign. Remember this phone uses a micro usb cable.<br />Also came along was a SIM card opener. Very useful so that I don't need to use a pin and possibly damage anything you know? This phone uses a MICRO SIM CARD, not the regular SIM. So if you don't have one, ask your carrier's store if you have those triple SIM card where the micro SIM is in there so you can insert the card in. Also, same place as the SIM is where you can place the MICRO SD CARD AS WELL. Useful for the extra storage.<br />What I am disappointed is that it did not came with a usb connector, which helps transfer files between and especially when you want to transfer via SMART SWITCH APP already pre-installed in the phone, and others as printing and etc. Just be prepared to wait perhaps hours if you have a lot of things to transfer from your old phone. I recommend using smart switch app because it transfers everything from your old phone and lets you control which ones to transfer too. You can also transfer wirelessly as well. You just need to open the app on the old phone and click the three dots upper right to open settings and the pin is there to use in the transfer process.<br /><br />So when you first start the phone, you will go through the steps to set the phone up. Don't worry about the SIM card insert or mobile data. You can do this later. Right now you want to get to the home screen. Once you are done, scroll around and see how the phone looks. Since this is a Verizon, you will see their apps. You don't have to use them, like the Verizon messaging is cool looking, but sucks when it does not have an organized contacts tab (not alphabetized), instead from the last person you contacted and you can't even search them up.<br />The phone is already updated, and personally, everything about the S7 Edge is an uprgrade for me from my S5. The phone I received looks good and performs good. I have not yet had an issue with it.<br />So now when you insert the SIM card, you will not automatically get your carrier data. This is where the special instructions begin, and I go more about this later on. What you do see is the notification that this is not a Verizon SIM card. You can easily clear this out or even force stop it by long tapping it, app info, and force stop it. But this will always reappear everyone you restart the phone. But honestly, this does not even bother me and just minor compared to how awesome the phone will be once I can get it to work under my data plan. I recommend backing up as I mentioned before after you get your data to work because what if you have problems with the phone? And your backup is installed in there and you then need to transfer back to your old phone or computer.<br /><br />So let me tell you that finding this Samsung Galaxy S7 ""EDGE"" is such a chore especially when you are searching for one with affordable pricing, color, and one that should be unlocked. I had to buy a refurbished phone because it is always cheaper and sometimes in a good scenario, all that happened to it was that it was ""used"" or opened from the box.<br />If you are buying a phone online, you must definitely do your research on whoever selling it and what the descriptions and return policies say. I bought this phone from seller BuySPRY. Previously, I had bought it from another seller. Sometimes, these phones are not directly from Samsung or Amazon, but is backed by Amazon and from certified refurbished third party sellers. So if anything goes wrong, you can count on Amazon having your back and that you can contact the seller as well. And that is exactly what happened to me and I did.<br /><br />You see, I highly suggest keep in contact with whoever selling the phone and emailing them directly making sure you get instructions and the information needed to unlock your phone. They emailed me first with a link saying Verizon guarantees never to lock their phones and provided a youtube link to unlocking the phone. To be frankly honest, I don't think the video helps too much for me lol, although I watched through it. Because, the real info you need all comes down to the phone's network settings where you need to input things as APN, Proxy, etc.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE CONFUSED IN WHAT TO DO TO GET YOUR DATA NETWORK ACTIVATED, IT IS BEST TO FIRST GO TO THE CARRIER'S STORE.<br />I have Metero PCS, and I was extremely lucky to have an employee there generously (btw, 15 bucks now to activate the phone to have it work under Metro PCS lol) help me out input the information for me. Also, not only that, you also need additional input for MMS TO WORK. Because the information provided is not enough (which I included) For Metero PCS, you need to give them the IMEI number for the phone. This is what I know only for Metro. I can't say for other carriers, but I could imagine it is all similar.<br /><br />After all that, I think you should be able to back up and then customize as you please.<br /><br />Also to point out, this phone has the function to show the clock when it is locked/turned off. This can get annoying and to mention waste of battery. You can easily disable this feature by going to settings, display and turn off always on display.<br /><br />So I hope you read to the end and that is this review helped you. I want you able to enjoy the new phone as I have and hope things go smoothly",5,positive

B01M7O431L,"on December 11, 2017",amzn1.account.AFEKPIAUC34EJ22IQDEX2NXUCCUQ,Refurbished device gamble paid off!,"I am so happy with this phone. I was a bit uneasy about buying a refurbished device, but my Galaxy Note 4 was broken, and I really did not want to shell out nearly $1K for the Note 8. So I figured I would try this refurbished S7 Edge and hope it would last long enough for the price to go down on the Note 8.<br /><br />This phone looks and works like brand new! I was able to contact Verizon and have them switch over to this device with no problems. About 24 hours after activating it, the phone did go through about 15 different software updates to bring it up to date, but I was expecting this to happen. After all the updates were finished, I did a quick wipe of the cache partition, and the phone has been working great. The package includes an adaptor for connecting to your old Samsung Galaxy phone to transfer all of your apps and data. I had all of my music on an SD card in my Note 4, and was able to move the card into the S7 Edge with no problems.  The phone did not come with the little tool for opening the SD/SIM card slot, but I just used the post of an earring to easily open it (you can also just use a paperclip or a thumbtack).<br /><br />I've been using the phone for 2 weeks now, and all of the functions work flawlessly - calls, texts, apps, Bluetooth connectivity, everything. I had originally planned to only use this phone for a year or so, but I like it so much, I hope it lasts longer.  One of my concerns with a refurbished device, especially one with a non-removable battery (the back of this particular phone does not easily pop open without specialized tools) was that the battery would already be old and would quickly die. I am happy to report that the battery in the phone that I received lasts a really long time. It would probably last several days in standby/light usage, and it easily lasts a day and half for me with heavy usage and lots of video streaming.  It comes with a Samsung Fast charging cable, and I have subsequently purchased the Samsung Wireless Charger to charge it wirelessly, and that works perfectly, too.<br /><br />If you are hesitating for the same reasons I was, I can recommend this device with no reservations.",5,positive

My reason from switching is that I don't believe Apple has been innovative since Steve Jobs passed away. They also throttled my phone to get a new one. So I did - a galaxy.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars is that this phone is claimed unlocked. I was under the impression, despite reading reviews, that it would also mean that the Verizon bloatware would be removed. It was not, so be warned that you'll have it on your phone. I use a phone service called Mint, which is a GSM carrier. This DOES work on this phone. You'll have to play with the settings but it'll get there.<br /><br />The phone is in perfect, new condition. No scratches at all. I would definitely recommend anyone to buy from this company and buy this product.",4,positive

I love the fact that Samsung is still offering analog headphone jack.<br />My major complains are:<br />1. Phone is very hard to hold for extended length of time due to its curved edged, if you aren't using a case.<br />2. My phone's finger print reader is lagging and not very accurate. It fails about 50% of the time. I've registered my fingers 3 times so far, no change.<br />3. Samsung and Verizon's useless apps take lots of memory and storage and slowdown the boot up time.<br />4. Speaker is very mediocre.<br />5. ""Back"" and ""Menu/ Current App"" buttons are the opposite of other Android devices.",4,positive

I bought this phone and it was fine for about 2 o 3 weeks before it started to malfunction. The phone would start itself when opening certain apps like netflix, but that was just the beginning. after about a month and a half after i bought it the phone went completely crazy, it would shut off randomly without it even being used, it would spend entire days and nights restarting itself over and over again. i took it to be fixed after one night it just stopped working entirely. i took it to get fixed, but i was told that there was nothing that could be done so now the phone sits in a drawer after a couple months of using it. my LG 3 lasted for nearly 4 years and this phone could not last 3 months.save yourself the trouble and money this phone will cost you.",1,negative

I use Cricket service and it does work just fine. You have to manually update the internet connection. A quick Google search can help you with that. Also, for Voicemail, you have to go into the call settings and change the voicemail from *86 to your phone number or it'll say you are calling an international number. Other than that, the phone is perfect. The packaging was a little mashed up, but the box doesn't affect how I use it. The camera is amazing!! It's fast as far as using apps, but it's slow to charge and the battery life isn't the best but for what it is and the price, I couldn't be happier. So if you use Cricket, this phone WILL work! Hope that helps!",5,positive

I took it to Verizon (phone is unlocked but is a Verizon phone, and came with instructions for using a sims card from a different carrier). Verizon said it was acting like I was putting a Verizon sims card in a phone for a different carrier. They recommended me doing a factory reset and trying again. Once I did this, it took the sims card with no problem and I love the phone. Looks and acts brand new.",4,positive
